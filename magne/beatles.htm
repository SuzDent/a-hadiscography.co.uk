	<p>The cover of the LP features a shot of four people alking across a zebra crossing in a street. The back cover features a large black and white &quot;live&quot; shot (top), a large coloured shot taken outside a venue (bottom) and 4 smaller shots (across the middle), presumably taken from the film. The track list is printed in white just above the small pictures. It comes with a full-sized white paper insert with track information, a small black and white shot of 4 people jumping (top left) and a shot of the 4 riding away from the camera on bikes (bottom right). The disc labels are green with a black silhouette of the 4 people jumping and other titles in black. The LP comes with a green obi-strip with a small picture of the 4 people jumping at the top and titles in white and yellow.</p>
