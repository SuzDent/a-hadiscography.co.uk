The album cover is white with the title in large white different sized letters against a dark red background as if some of the white background has been ripped away to reveal the title behind.</p>

The spine is white with the artist and title printed in black and red font respectively.</p>
<p>The 6-page lyric booklet is housed in the left hand side of the sleeve. The front and back of the booklet are plain white. Inside are the lyrics printed in black font. The disc is housed in the right hand side of the sleeve. It is white with a picture of a broken Christmas bauble with gold inside and top. Around the edge of the disc is copyright and manufacturing information in small black letters.
