On 25 October 2019, Magne Furuholmen released his album &quot;White Xmas Lies&quot; on Drabant Music. It was available on CD, LP and a special limited edition LP.</p>
The album cover is white with the title in large white different sized letters against a dark red background as if some of the white background has been ripped away to reveal the title behind.</p>

<p>The CD and standard LP both come in a fold-out white card sleeve. In the centre of the sleeve on the left-hand side is the title in small red letters at the top with track information and credits below. On the bottom right-hand side of the CD sleeve and bottom left of the LP sleeve (the right hand side of the LP sleeve is blank), there is a short message from Magne printed in black. The background of the centre sleeves features the track titles printed in white glossy letters which shine in the light. The reverse of the sleeves are plain white with the tracks listed in red on the left side and the &quot;Drabant Music&quot; logo and copyright information in black at the bottom. The LP has the track list split into four with &quot;SIDE A&quot;, &quot;SIDE B&quot;, &quot;SIDE C&quot; and &quot;SIDE D&quot; between in black letters. 
The spines are white with the artist and title printed in black and red font respectively.</p>
<p>The CD has a 6-page lyric booklet housed in the left hand side of the sleeve. The front and back of the booklet are plain white. Inside are the lyrics printed in black font. The CD itself is housed in the right hand side of the sleeve. The disc is white and features a picture of a broken Christmas bauble with gold inside and top. Around the edge of the disc is copyright and manufacturing information in small black letters.</p>

  <p>The two LPs come in white sleeves with the lyrics printed in black font. The LPs are white heavy-weight vinyl with coloured labels, each featuring a different coloured broken bauble. The tracks are printed in white (black on side C) over the top of the bauble (side A: gold, side B: black, side C: green and side D: red) with copyright and manufacturing information in small black letters around the edge of the label. Magne signed the front of several of the LPs which were available for sale during the tour.</p>
