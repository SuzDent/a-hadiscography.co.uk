<p>This album was available in Norway on 15th December '98 as a special limited edition.

It comes in a hermetically sealed lead cover with &quot;HERMETIC&quot; stamped in the centre. The cover opens to reveal the CD between protective sheets. The disc is yellow with black art by Magne. Only 100 copies were produced and each cover was hand made and signed by Magne. Kjetil put together the music, a unique music composition for each CD and recorded them onto the discs himself. This limited edition comes in a large white strong envelope with a black sticker in the centre. The sticker warns of the lead content.</p>

The only text on the sleeve is the title &quot;furuholmen / bjerkestrand / wadling&quot; &quot;Hermetic&quot; in respectively black and white letters on the front and spine.
There is also some black text printed on one of the white abstract shapes in the centre of the digi-pak.
