Morten's second English sung solo album &quot;Letter From Egypt&quot; was released in Norway on 19 May 2008. The cover features a shot of Morten in Morocco, standing just outside a circle of rocks which have red religious symbols painted on them. In the background there is a girl standing by a deserted telephone box and a car on a distant track. Above the picture, &quot;morten harket&quot; is included in white hand written letters, with the title &quot;LETTER FROM EGYPT&quot; typed in black typewriter font underneath. The cover gives the effect to look like it has a big crease down the centre and along the bottom of the sleeve.</p>

The discs are black with white titles and text. &quot;morten harket&quot; is again displayed handwritten below the centre ring with the album title &quot;LETTER FROM EGYPT&quot; in typewriter font underneath.
