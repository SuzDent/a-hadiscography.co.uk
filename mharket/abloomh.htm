The Russian edition comes with a large white obi strip with a black and white shot of Morten sitting down playing a guitar. &quot;Morten Harket&quot; is printed in dark blue at the top with the title &quot;out of my hands&quot; in grey. There is some additional text in Russian printed in grey &quot;НОВЫЙ АЛЬБОМ ЭКС-ЛИДЕРА&quot; and &quot;ЛУЧШЕГО ВОКАЛИСТА В ИСТОРИИ ПОП-МУЗЫКИ&quot; with "A-HA" in-between printed in large light blue letters which translates to &quot;NEW EX-A-HA LEADER ALBUM, BEST VOCALIST IN HISTORY OF POP MUSIC&quot;.

On the back of the obi, there are adverts for two albums by other artists &quot;LANA DEL REY <<BORN TO DIE>>&quot; and &quot;GOTYE <<MAKING MIRRORS>>&quot; with some Russian text in blue underneath for each one; &quot;Дебютный альбом американской певицы, рабютный на стыке музыкальных жанров. Пресса и критики в один голос наэывает Лану Дель Рей лучшей новой исполнительницей, и это неудивительно, ведь Лана сводит воедино два полюса поп-муэыки - с одной стороны, она наэывает себя (гангстерской версией Нэнси Синатры) и воскрешает шик старого Голливуда, а с другой - открывает своим творчеством новый этап раэвития массовой культуры&quot;. and &quot;Новый альбом талантливого мульти-инструменталиста, лидера европейских чартов. Творчество Готье по праву можно считать новой ступенью в эволюции муэыки, что подтверждается его феноменальным успехом&quot;. There is a grey coloured triangular shaped pattern of squares to the right of each advert. At the bottom of the back obi, it includes a navy blue stripe with white text containing some other Russian text &quot;ВСЕ САМЫЕ ПОСЛЕДНИЕ НОВОСТИ ОБ АРТИСТАХ И РЕЛИЗАХ UNIVERSAL MUSIC - НА САЙТЕ&quot; which advertises &quot;ALL THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT ARTISTS AND RELEASES VISIT THE  WWW.UNIVERSAL.MUSIC.RU&quot; on-line website. A white barcode is also included at the bottom, but displaying a different number &quot;4 605026 710672&quot; compared to the European release. On the spine of the obi is the regular blue and grey coloured title &quot;morten harket out of my hands&quot; displayed landscaped in the centre, with the &quot;UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP INTERNATIONAL&quot; logo orientated at the bottom. There is also a small silver hologram sticker at the bottom right-hand corner on the front of the CD case, which includes the &quot;UNIVERSAL ООО «Юниверсал Мьюзик» logo, and AD 287199 printed in black.
