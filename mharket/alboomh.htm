<p>There are at least two slightly different EU made pressings of the album. A second one has been printed with darker colours and the text on the back is green, rather than grey. The inside of the back sleeve is printed the wrong way up so that the white strip (cream on the UK/EU pressing) is on the right hand side, rather than left.</p>

<H4>Russia</H4>
The Russian edition comes with a large white obi strip with a black and white shot of Morten sitting down playing a guitar. &quot;Morten Harket&quot; is printed in dark blue at the top with the title &quot;out of my hands&quot; in grey. There is some additional text in Russian printed in grey &quot;НОВЫЙ АЛЬБОМ ЭКС-ЛИДЕРА&quot; and &quot;ЛУЧШЕГО ВОКАЛИСТА В ИСТОРИИ ПОП-МУЗЫКИ&quot; with "A-HA" in-between printed in large light blue letters which translates to &quot;NEW EX-A-HA LEADER ALBUM, BEST VOCALIST IN HISTORY OF POP MUSIC&quot;. The Russian Radio station &quot;Romantika&quot; is advertised in purple at the bottom. On the back of the obi, there are adverts for two albums by other artists &quot;LANA DEL REY <<BORN TO DIE>>&quot; and &quot;GOTYE <<MAKING MIRRORS>>&quot; with some Russian text in blue underneath for each one; &quot;Дебютный альбом американской певицы, рабютный на стыке музыкальных жанров. Пресса и критики в один голос наэывает Лану Дель Рей лучшей новой исполнительницей, и это неудивительно, ведь Лана сводит воедино два полюса поп-муэыки - с одной стороны, она наэывает себя (гангстерской версией Нэнси Синатры) и воскрешает шик старого Голливуда, а с другой - открывает своим творчеством новый этап раэвития массовой культуры&quot;. and &quot;Новый альбом талантливого мульти-инструменталиста, лидера европейских чартов. Творчество Готье по праву можно считать новой ступенью в эволюции муэыки, что подтверждается его феноменальным успехом&quot;. There is a grey coloured triangular shaped pattern of squares to the right of each advert. At the bottom of the back obi, it includes a navy blue stripe with white text containing some other Russian text &quot;ВСЕ САМЫЕ ПОСЛЕДНИЕ НОВОСТИ ОБ АРТИСТАХ И РЕЛИЗАХ UNIVERSAL MUSIC - НА САЙТЕ&quot; which advertises &quot;ALL THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT ARTISTS AND RELEASES VISIT THE  WWW.UNIVERSAL.MUSIC.RU&quot; on-line website. A white barcode is also included at the bottom, but displaying a different number &quot;4 605026 710672&quot; compared to the European release. On the spine of the obi is the regular blue and grey coloured title &quot;morten harket out of my hands&quot; displayed landscaped in the centre, with the &quot;UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP INTERNATIONAL&quot; logo orientated at the bottom. There is also a small silver hologram sticker at the bottom right-hand corner on the front of the CD case, which includes the &quot;UNIVERSAL ООО «Юниверсал Мьюзик» logo, and AD 287199 printed in black. The back sleeve comes with the usual layout including the track listing to each side in grey, www.mortenharket.com website address and all three regular &quot;UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP&quot;, &quot;ISLAND&quot; and &quot;WE LOVE MUSIC&quot; logos. The same white barcode &quot;4 605026 710672&quot; which appears on the obi strip, is included in the bottom left-hand corner. Along the bottom of the back sleeve, the album also displays that Compass Point AS released the CD under exclusive licence to Universal Music Domestic Pop, a division of Universal Music GmbH, but includes some additional Russian manufacturing and copyright information and Record Company and website addresses; &quot;℗© 2012 Compass Point AS under exclusive license to Universal Music Domestic Pop, a division of Universal Music GmbH.©℗ ООО «Юниверсал Мьюзик» 2012., Россия 121096. г.

The disc is similar to the European release but with white text in place of the silver which is quite difficult to read.
