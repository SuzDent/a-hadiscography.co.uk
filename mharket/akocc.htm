Morten's first internationally released single &quot;A Kind Of Christmas Card&quot; was written by H�vard Rem, mixed by Simon Hurrell and produced by Christopher Neil. There was no vinyl-release of this single, however there were two 5&quot; CD-singles. 
<table border="0">
<tr><td>The regular CD-single comes in a normal jewel case. The cover features a picture of a type-writer with a black and white shot of Morten seen coming out of it. Along the top, the title is printed in black `type-writer' print on individual white strips. The reverse of the insert is black with all text written in black typed letters on white strips. The spine of the insert is black with titles in white.</td>

<P>The CD is black with black `typed' text on white strips, in a similar style to the reverse of the insert. There is also a white WB-logo on the left hand side.  The tracks on the CD feature the single version of &quot;A Kind Of Christmas Card&quot; (3:50), &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; (5:57) which is a cover version of a Sam Cooke song, recorded live at Helgerud church in Norway and the album version of &quot;Lay Me Down Tonight&quot; (2:18).</P>
<P>Also available is a limited edition CD-single which comes in an album style case. The insert (which itself is a 4�&quot;x4�&quot; card with plain white reverse) is similar to that of the regular release, but the picture is seen more close up and is printed in a blue tone. In addition, the black title on two white strips is positioned along the bottom. This limited edition release features 3 colour photographic prints of Morten. The backing insert of the CD is black with the title printed in black on white strips and additional text printed in white at the bottom of the sleeve.</P>

<tr><td>The actual CD is similar to the regular release, but the colour used on the black disc is light blue rather than white. Also the text at the bottom is printed in light blue letters on the disc rather than on white strips. It features the same tracks as the regular CD-single.</td>

<tr><td>There is also a promo 5&quot; CD single which comes in a jewel case. It features a close-up version of the picture that was seen coming out of the type-writer on the regular release, printed in a brown tone. The title is 'type' printed in black on individual white strips and placed at the bottom of the sleeve.</td>

The reverse of the insert is similar to the regular release, except that the title is printed in a larger font and the rest of the text is more spread out on the individual strips. The disc is also similar to that of the regular CD with a slight difference in the type of print and strips on which the text is printed. The WB-logo is much smaller and has been placed at the bottom. The words &quot;Promo Only - Not For Resale&quot; have been printed on the CD. Most copies also have a wea records promo sticker on the front with release date, names and contact numbers. 
<table border="0">
<tr><td>There exists another promo CD which features the two tracks &quot;A Kind Of Christmas Card&quot; (4:09) and &quot;Spanish Steps&quot; (4:08). This is just a CD-R copy which comes in a white &quot;tape to tape&quot; wea records paper sleeve with black titles plus large grey &quot;Tape to Tape&quot; logo in the background. The release date given on the sleeve is 21 / 8 / 95 and on the disc 18 / 8 / 95.</td>

</table>
The disc is just a regular CD-recordable disc on which the titles have been hand written. This disc was probably sent out for promotional purposes.</P>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>The cassette single has cover similar to the regular CD-single, except that you can see more of the typewriter at the bottom and the text along the top is printed in two lines. The spine is black with the title written in black typed letters on two white strips. There is also a white WB-logo at the bottom.</td> 
<td><IMG WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="150" SRC="mhpics/akocccas.jpg" ALT="A Kind Of Christmas Card Cassette Single"</td></tr>

The reverse of the insert is again similar to the reverse of the CD insert, but the WB-logo is missing while the copyright text has been added along the bottom. The cassette is black with white titles and plays the same on both sides.
