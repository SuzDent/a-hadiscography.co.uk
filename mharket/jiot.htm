This 1 track promo only CD &quot;A Jester in our Town&quot; was released by Polydor. The song is taken from the musical Sophie's World and is performed by Morten. It can also be found on the soundtrack album <A HREF="othermh.htm#jiot">Sophie's World</A>. The CD cover is much the same as the album cover, featuring a blue and pink picture of the left-hand side of a girl's face wearing a globe ear ring. The title is printed in white across the middle of the sleeve.
