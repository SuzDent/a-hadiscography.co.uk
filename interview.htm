<H2>Amnesty International Discs (unofficial)</H2>
<HR>
<P>There are series of Amnesty International 7&quot; picture discs which are thought to be unofficial. Several of them include pictures of a-ha, mainly taken from books or magazine articles and often with parts of the picture missing (such as a band member's head!) or just part of the text from an article or book. Therefore these discs seem to be very unofficial. They do not have catalogue numbers.
<P>Series 1: 14 discs</P>
