<p>There are many 'unofficial' or 'bootleg' a-ha releases. This section aims to give some basic details and pictures of some of these unofficial releases. The list is by no means exhaustive and with new releases (especially compilations) being released on a fairly regular basis, it is almost impossible to track them all. Some of the more 'interesting' unofficial releases will be listed here. Track listings below include any spelling mistakes printed on the releases, often these mistakes can be a give away that the release is unofficial!</p>

<HR>
<p>This American made double-LP has a black and white cover with &quot;a-ha days night&quot; in white typewriter letters at the top and the original a-ha logo across the cover. It features live songs from a-ha's concerts at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, UK on 16th December 1986. Underneath there are three very dark photos of Magne, P&aring;l and Morten, probably taken from the official tour programme. The back cover has a large promo photo of the three guys and the songs are listed.</p>

<H3>The Living Daylights (1987)</H3>
<HR>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="157" SRC="bootleg/tldlivelp.jpg" ALT="The Living Daylights" ALIGN="right">
	This double-LP by Nurve Records Ltd, 182 Kingsberg Road, London SW3 was made in England. This release features a concert recorded on June 29th 1987 in Osaka, Japan and credits several people for its production and release. The cover features a picture of a-ha taken from photo session of the presentation of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. The reverse of the sleeve features two live photographs with green text over the top, including the track listing (complete with mistakes, such as &quot;Taxi&quot; (Touchy!) and track 3 on side two (The Swing Of Things) has not been listed at all!).</p>
<p>The sound quality of this album isn't too great, but a slight improvement on &quot;Take On a-ha&quot;. One problem, however, is that the pressing has a slight defect and the record runs too fast even at 'correct speed' of 33 1/3 RPM.</p>
<p><B>Tracks:</B> Cry Wolf / Maybe Maybe / Here I Stand And Face The Rain / Manhattan Skyline / The Sun Always Shines On T.V. / Scoundrel Days / We're Looking For The Whales // The Weight Of The Wind / Hunting High And Low / Taxi / Take On Me // The Living Daylights / I've Been Losing You / And You Tell Me.</p>

<p>The reverse cover repeats the title and the blue lines, but text replaces the band picture. The text includes track list, date and venue (Hammersmith Odeon, London 18th December 1986), details of the band (including Dag Kolsrud (keyboards), Michael Sturgis (drums) and Leif Karsten Johansen (bass guitar)), it also states that the LP is a promotional copy not for sale !.

The cover of this unofficial release features the picture as found on the reverse of the &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; album. A grey &quot;a-ha&quot; logo and pink title has been printed on the picture. The CD insert folds out exposing a black and white a-ha photo (as found in the &quot;Memorial Beach&quot; booklet). The actual CD is silver with black text and pink &quot;greatest hits&quot; title.</p>
<p>The album has the same track listing as &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; album, but two additional tracks, &quot;Memorial Beach&quot; and &quot;Lie Down In Darkness&quot;, have been tagged on the end. Although these tracks are last on the disc, they have been listed incorrectly on the sleeve as being before &quot;The Sun Always Shines On The TV&quot;. One of the give aways that it is an unofficial release (apart from the unprofessional look of the sleeve / disc design) is the fact that there is no mention of a record company or the country of manufacture! It is believed that this release was available in Bulgaria.</p>

<H3>Lifelines (2002)</H3>
<HR>
<p>As with &quot;Minor Earth, Major Sky&quot; there was a Russian release with bonus tracks. The cover is similar to the regular release, but brighter red in colour and with &quot;+ BONUS&quot; printed in yellow letters towards the bottom of the sleeve. The back sleeve differs from the regular release with a different picture and fonts. The disc is a picture disc, similar to the front sleeve of the album. The bonus tracks are: Minor Earth Major Sky, Angel In The Snow, Little Black Heart and You'll Never Get Over Me.</p>

There is another &quot;Lifelines&quot; album with bonus. This one claims to be German made and includes &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; (4:37), &quot;Velvet&quot; (4:19) and &quot;Minor Earth, Major Sky&quot; (5:24) as extra tracks. The cover is much the same as the regular German release, but the bonus tracks have been tagged on the end of the track list in white (other tracks are listed in red). This item is believed to be unofficial and doesn't have a catalogue number. 
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="118" SRC="bootleg/lifelines_asia.jpg" ALT="Lifelines + Bonus - Asia / EU"></p>
<p>This &quot;Lifelines + bonus&quot; release by Panda Music was found in Asia, but claims to be made in the EU. It doesn't have a catalogue number as such, but there is a barcode with number on the reverse. The front cover is similar to the official releases, but has &quot;+ bonus&quot; printed under the title and the &quot;Panda Music&quot; logo in the bottom right hand corner. The back sleeve has the track list printed down the left hand side and again the Panda Music logo is in the right hand corner. The a-ha logo is a greenish yellow colour. The rest of the artwork and disc differ quite a lot compared to the official releases and features some early shots of the band plus information. The disc is similar to the front sleeve, but has an old band shot super-imposed on the design! The bonus tracks are Early Morning, Take On Me (radio version), Summer Moved On and Minor Earth Major Sky.
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="116" SRC="bootleg/lifelines_ger2.jpg" ALT="Lifelines + 3 Bonus (back sleeve)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Another, &quot;German made&quot; release which was found in Asia has a similar cover to the official release, but on the back sleeve the 3 bonus tracks (Summer Moved On (4:37), Velvet (4:19) and Minor Earth Major Sky (5:24)) have been appended to the bottom of the track list in a colour which doesn't quite match the rest of the list (the extra tracks are more pink than red!). Also the text &quot;+3 bonus&quot; has been printed on the spines in pink. The CD insert is similar to the regular release, but some of the pictures have been printed in black and white.
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="118" SRC="bootleg/lifelines_asia2.jpg" ALT="Lifelines - Asia? (back sleeve)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Yet another &quot;unofficial&quot; release of &quot;Lifelines&quot; found in Asia. This one doesn't have any bonus tracks. The front sleeve is similar to the official releases, but the insert, back sleeve and disc differ. The back sleeve has the track list in white and is made to look like it is glowing as the text is very blurred. The disc is similar to the front cover of the album. Apparently this album was released by &quot;Capitol Music&quot; and has a unique catalogue number.

<H3>a-ha the anthology (2002)</H3>
<HR>
<p>This unofficial collection of 16 a-ha remixes has a similar cover to the &quot;Lifelines&quot; 'red' European single release. Compared to the front cover of the European single, the arches pictured on the front are more close-up so that the steps cannot be seen. The title is printed in dark letters on a white strip under the a-ha logo and &quot;b-sides, rarities &amp; remixes&quot; is printed in white in the bottom left hand corner of the sleeve. The reverse and inside of the insert features more shots of the red arches. The track list is printed in white on the reverse of the insert. Inside the insert there is quite a long paragraphy giving a brief 'history' of the band.</p>

<p>The back insert features a very stretched shot of the arches. There is a white rounded rectangular in the centre on which the tracks lists are printed. The insert claims that it is a Universal Island Records, Made in the EU although the e-mail address given is a Russian one! The disc itself is white with light orange a-ha logo and black text.</p>

	<p>There is another, possibly European release of this DVD which was manufactured by Showtime (instead of the Brazilian Coqueiro Verde Records). The quality of this release seems poorer than the Brazilian release.
The Design of this European Showtime Release is very similar to the Brazilian Release but with some differences:
The disc is black with the title in blue/green and white letter at the top plus the copyright information and logos in white, biut no pictures. The disc and cover include
a &quot;FSK 0&quot; logo (on the right hand side of the disc, bottom left hand side of the cover). At the bottom centre of the disc
there are 'DVD Video', 'SHOWTIME' and GEMA logos. Printed around the bottom outer edge of the disc is 'P + C 2009 Showtime Movies and Music Ltd. All rights reserved. WARNING: For private use only. Unauthorised public performance, broadcasting or copying is a violation of applicable laws.'.</p>
<p>The front cover is similar to the Brazilian release, but the pink circle has the text in English &quot;INCL ALL THE HITS!&quot; plus there is a small white &quot;SHOWTIME&quot; logi in the top right hand corner.
On the back cover, the tracking listing is in two columns, rather than one and the format and subtitle information is displayed in a chart form and the playing format of this showtime DVD is region free NTSC. At the bottom of the back cover is the 'Showtime', GEMA, 'FSK 0' and 'DVD Video' logos, plus a smaller sized barcode and some copyright information which reads: 'P + C 2009 Showtime Movies and Music Ltd. all rights reserved, WARNING: For private use only. Unauthorised public performance, broadcasting or copying is a violation of applicable laws. Dolby and the Dolby-D symbol are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation.'.</P>
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="132" SRC="bootleg/chile06b.jpg" ALT="a-ha line in Chile 06 CD"></p>
<p>There is also a CD 'release' (2000 copies pressed) which comes in a cardboard digipak case and has the same 12 live tracks from the Chile show. It was 'released' by Coqueiro Verde Records (WWW.coqueiroverderecords.com). Also on the back cover are the flying Amazon bird and recycling logos. The artwork of the CD is similar to the DVD. The CD itself differs from the DVD which is black with lots of small live pictures at the bottom. The title is in white and blue at the top.</p>

<p>This DVD/CD release is thought to be an unofficial release from Argentina by garra records. There are three different versions, a DVD release, a CD release and a deluxe CD and DVD edition.
