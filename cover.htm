<p>A CD of 10 a-ha cover versions &quot;a tribute to a-ha&quot; was released in Brazil by the band &quot;Falling From Mars&quot;.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="297" HEIGHT="150" SRC="cover/tribute1.jpg" ALT="falling from mars - a tribute to a-ha (cover 1)"></p>
<p>There are two slightly different covers for this album. Both show a blue/green shot of a-ha (P&aring;l, Magne, Morten) with band information printed on the reverse of the front insert. The difference is in the titles. The first release has &quot;a tribute to a-ha by falling from mars&quot; printed on the front and reverse of the insert, the other just has &quot;a tribute to &nbsp; by falling from mars&quot;. The back inserts and discs are similar to the front covers except that the colours vary slightly and the second release has &quot;a tribute to a- by falling from mars&quot; on the reverse! The second release was the one available in the shops.

<p>The Norwegian duo Diva released this cover version on CD-single and 12&quot; in the UK and on two different CD singles in Norway. There was a further CD single released in Germany and a double 12&quot; promo.</p>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>The cover of the UK CD single and 12&quot; is honey coloured with a picture of Diva and the title written in blue. The back of the insert of the CD-single is greeny blue with large blue &quot;Diva&quot; logo with orange trim plus the tracks printed in blue. The CD itself is bright pink with a large blue-edged silver &quot;Diva&quot; logo and the tracks written in blue.</td>

The CD features six different remixes of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; - &quot;Radio Edit&quot; (3:23), &quot;Perfecto Mix&quot; (8:05), &quot;Sunshine Mix&quot; (6:10) , &quot;Volcano Club Edit&quot; (3:31), &quot;Sexy Disco Dub&quot; (9:05) and &quot;Original Version&quot; (4:54). The 12&quot; has a completely different track list with the &quot;Crucial Club Mix&quot; (5:18), &quot;Original Version&quot; (4:54), &quot;Crucial Hard Dub Mix&quot; (5:53) and &quot;Crucial Club Edit&quot; (3:42). The single was released on &quot;eastwest&quot; (a division of &quot;Warner Music&quot;).
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="150" SRC="cover/diva_cas.jpg" ALT="Diva - UK Cassette Single"></p>
<p>There is also a UK cassette single which features the &quot;Original Version&quot; (4:54) and the &quot;Perfecto Mix&quot; (8:05). The front cover is similar to the CD single, the inside of the insert is blue with a large yellow Diva logo, the tracks listed in dark blue and additional information in yellow. The spine is blue with dark blue title and eastwest logo plus catalogue number in yellow.  The cassette itself is transparent and black with white text. It plays the same on both sides.</p>
<table BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><p>There is a DJ promo CD-single which has a similar cover to the regular UK release, but has a white spine rather than a blue one. The reverse of the sleeve differs from the regular release, being pink with blue and white titles, of similar design to the actual disc.</TD>

The disc of this promo release also differs slightly from the regular release - the title and Diva letters are white rather than silver and the tracks are printed in white above the title, rather than in blue below the title. The disc also states that it is for promotional use and not for re-sale. It features only four mixes of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; &quot;Radio Edit&quot; (3:23), &quot;Original Version&quot; (4:54), &quot;Perfecto Mix&quot; (8:05) and &quot;Volcano Club Mix&quot; (3:32).</p>

The titles are printed in coloured letters above. The discs also differ being light grey with &quot;Diva&quot; printed in light blue on the right hand side rather than bright pink.</p>
<p>The cover of the German release is similar to the UK release but features the following seven remixes of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot;: &quot;Radio Edit&quot; (3:23), &quot;Crucial Club Mix&quot; (5:18), &quot;Perfecto Mix&quot; (8:05), &quot;Sunshine Mix&quot; (6:24), &quot;Crucial Hard Dub Mix&quot; (5:53), &quot;Original Version&quot; (4:54) and &quot;Crucial Club Edit&quot; (3:42).</p>
