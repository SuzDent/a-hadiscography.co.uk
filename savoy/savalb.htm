The EMI inhouse promo CD-R comes in album case with inhouse inlay, but no backing insert. The disc is a regular <NOBR>CD-R</NOBR> (KODAK and Xeo Elite editions exist), some of which have been written on by hand. 
The double sided front insert is similar to the front and back of the regular album insert, but the fonts used differ. The track listing and order of the tracks also differs from the regular release:
<p>Lackluster Me (4:30) / Unsound (5:02) / You should�ve Told Me (4:32) / Easy (3:23) / I Still Cry (4:44) / Sycamore Leaves (3:36) / Rain (4:20) [Note: The track time is actually 5:14) / Butt Out (2:53) / This That &amp; The Other (4:19) / Hey Luchie (2:35) / Foreign Film (3:58) / Flowers For Sylvia (2:11) / If You Tell (4:21) [Version on the disc is actually 4:47, i.e. longer than on the regular release]
<p>Another EMI inhouse promo comes in an album case with inhouse front inlay, but with a hand written track list. These copies were issued to some of the most important Press contacts as the printing of the regular release was slightly delayed. Again the discs are just white topped CD-Rs (KODAK and Maxoptix editions exist), some of which have been written on by hand. The font used in the title on the front sleeve again differs from the regular release.
The hand written list has inaccuracies regarding spelling and length of songs, but the disc is identical to the other EMI inhouse album:
<p>Lackluster Me (4:30) / Unsound (5:02) / You Should�ve Told Me (4:32) / Foreign Film (3:55) / Flowers For Sylvia (2:10) / I Still Cry (4:44) / Sycamore Leaves (3:35) / Rain (5:14) / Butt Out (2:53) / This That &amp; The Other (4:13) / Hey Luchioe (2:35) / Easy (3:23) / If You Tell (4:20) [Track length is actually 4:47]

<p>Promo copies of the album sampler CD come in a jewel case without an actual CD insert. Some copies come with a grey sticker with the title printed in white on the front of the jewel case. Around 250 copies were distributed inside a 21cm x 21cm fold out card picture sleeve.

This sleeve has four flaps which open out. The picture on the outside is similar to the album cover but the large silver Savoy-logo is written all the way across the top (although only the letters A, V and O can be seen as the rest cuts off). Inside the sleeve, the middle is similar to the inside of the CD booklet - black with large dirty looking red, orange and yellow printers leters reading  &quot;Lack&quot; &quot;luster&quot; &quot;Me&quot; in three different lines. The insides of the flaps are dark red with information on Savoy, a-ha and the tracks on the new album. There are also small black and white pictures featuring the band members. The whole sleeve is fastened together by a piece of silvery tape with the words &quot;Lackluster Me Savoy&quot; in white letters.</p>

It features the additional musicians: Bj&oslash;rg V&oslash;rnes, Henning B&aring;tnes, Elise B&aring;tnes, Andre Orvik, Frode Larsen, Harvey de Souza, S&oslash;lve Sigerland, Berit V&aelig;rnes and Atle Sponberg on strings (tracks 1,3,8 and 12); Lasse Rossing on trumpet (tracks 1 and 3); J&oslash;run B&oslash;geberg on bass (tracks 2 and 3); Sven Lindvall on bass (track 1); Per Lindvall on drums (track 1); Magne Furuholmen on Clavicord (track 6) and Preben Grieg-Halvorsen on keyboard and programming (tracks 4, 7 and 12).

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><p>Lauren Savoy designed the cover of the album. The front of the regular release is white with twelve coloured shots of Lauren and Paul arranged in columns of three in the bottom section of the sleeve.

In addition, there is a light grey box printed above the first column of Lauren pictures. The Savoy logo is printed in black in the top right hand corner with the text ...&quot;I wish there could be&quot; and the album title (in grey and dark green letters respectively) underneath. The tracks are printed in small letters above the coloured boxes, each one is given a 4 digit code starting y2 and followed by the track number (like the Pantone colour system). The last track, &quot;Tongue Tied&quot;, is spelt incorrectly on the sleeve as &quot;Tounge Tied&quot;.</p>
<p>The reverse of the 6 page booklet features a picture of Paul sitting in front of some trees and a mountain. Outlines of tweleve boxes, arranged in the same manner as on the cover of the booklet have been printed over the bottom part of the picture. Inside the booklet there are two more purple-tone shots of Paul and Lauren, a colour shot of the band (centre pages), a scenic shot of the mountains plus the lyrics which have been printed in white text on dark blue and dark green pages. The box outlines have been used throughout the booklet, always printed in the bottom section of the page.</p>
