<p>The second promo single &quot;Half Of The Time&quot; from Savoy's album &quot;Reasons To Stay Indoors&quot; was released to Norwegian radio stations around 26th November. The cover of this 1 track promo shows a brown toned black and white shot of the band (Lauren, Paul and Frode) standing on rocks. The title and Savoy logo are printed in dark red towards the top of the sleeve. The reverse of the sleeve is similar to the back sleeve of the album with a yellow sunset over the sea with track information printed in the top left hand corner. The disc itself is a mustard yellow colour with black text. The promo features only a radio edit of &quot;Half Of The Time&quot; (4:08).</p>
