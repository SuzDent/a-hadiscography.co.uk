A further promotional only 1-track Savoy CD-single was released to radio stations in Norway. 
The cover is bright blue and features a shadowy picture of the dolls head found on the cover of the &quot;Lackluster Me&quot; album, but it has been pictured from a distance. The eyes of the doll are glowing white and the true colours of the dolls face can only been seen through a small rectangle over the mouth section. The Savoy logo and title have been printed in the bottom right hand corner.

<br/>The reverse of the sleeve is a metallic blue colour. The Savoy logo is in black at the top with four small black and white shadowy pictures of dolls heads printed down the sleeve (the same as those found on the reverse of the &quot;Foreign Film&quot; sleeve). Additional black text has been printed down the sleeve, to the left of the pictures.

<tr><td>The disc is also a metallic blue colour and again has a rough matt feel to it. The Savoy logo is silver and additional text is dark blue.
