            <p>The album was also relased on CD by Apollon Records. It comes in a regular jewel case, but the artwork differs from the original release. The front cover features the same shot of the cracked dolls face, but the logo has been updated to the one used on the other re-issue and latest album. The logo is still in a silver font, but larger than on the original release. The title is in smaller black font underneat, narrower than the one used on the original release. The 8 double sided paged CD booklet is black with the lyrics printed in silver grey with two small black and white shots of te band standing in front of a leafy tree. There is a double spread sot of the band in the centre of the bookley from the same photo shoot. There are two double spread pages with information about the album with quotes from the band. On the back is another small black and white shot of te band plus recording information.</p>
            <p>The disc is matt silver grey with the new Savoy logo and title at the top and the Apollon records label at the bottom cut out to show the silver shine of the disc. Underneath the disc, you can see another shot of the crakced dolls face, but this time with the eyes shut. There are no small black and white shots of the doll down the edge of te spine as there are on the original release. The reverse sleeve in silver with the track list in black plus the 4 small black and white shots of the doll printed in the four corners. The Apollon Records logo and address plus barcode are at the bottom. The CD comes with a double sided paper insert advertisting the forthcoming re-issyes of Mountains Of Time (May 2017) and Reasons To Stay Indoors (July 2017), but it seems the latter of which was never released. It also pronotes releases of Frode Unnelands other bands and other releases by Apollon Records.</p>
