<p>The first promo single &quot;You Won't Come To The Party&quot; from Savoy's album &quot;Reasons To Stay Indoors&quot; was released to Norwegian radio stations around 3rd September. The single probably won't be released commercially. The promo single includes the Radio Edit (3:59) and the Album Version (4:25) of &quot;You Won't Come To The Party&quot;. The track was written by Waaktaar-Savoy, produced by Savoy and mixed by Sebastian Schmidt.</p>

<p>The cover features a darkened shot of one end of a rounded corner sofa with a lamp standing on a table in the foreground. The title is printed in white letters at the top on the left hand side of the sleeve with the Savoy logo in red letters below.</p>
<p>The reverse of the sleeve has a picture of what looks like an ariel view of the base of a lamp against a brown background. The tracks and credits are printed in white letters in the top left hand corner of the sleeve.
<p>The disc itself is black with the Savoy logo in red on the left hand side at the top plus the titles and other text in white on the right hand side.</TD>
