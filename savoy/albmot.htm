<TR><TD><p>Lauren Savoy designed the cover of the album. The front of the regular release is white with twelve coloured shots of Lauren and Paul arranged in columns of three in the bottom section of the sleeve. The first two columns feature a picture of Lauren, printed respectively in grey and blue-tones. The third and fourth columns feature a picture of Paul, printed respectively in green and orange-tones.

</TABLE>
In addition, there is a light grey box printed above the first column of Lauren pictures. The Savoy logo is printed in black in the top right hand corner with the text ...&quot;I wish there could be&quot; and the album title (in grey and dark green letters respectively) underneath. The tracks are printed in small letters above the coloured boxes, each one is given a 4 digit code starting y2 and followed by the track number (like the Pantone colour system). The last track, &quot;Tongue Tied&quot;, is spelt incorrectly on the sleeve as &quot;Tounge Tied&quot;.</p>
<p>The reverse of the 6 page booklet features a picture of Paul sitting in front of some trees and a mountain. Outlines of tweleve boxes, arranged in the same manner as on the cover of the booklet have been printed over the bottom part of the picture. Inside the booklet there are two more purple-tone shots of Paul and Lauren, a colour shot of the band (centre pages), a scenic shot of the mountains plus the lyrics which have been printed in white text on dark blue and dark green pages. The box outlines have been used throughout the booklet, always printed in the bottom section of the page.</p>

<tr><td>The back insert of the album is of similar design to the front but the colours used are tones of grey, green and purple. The first two columns feature a picture of Frode, printed in different tones, where as the last two columns are left blank. The tracks are printed above the boxes in a similar way to the front (spelling mistake still intact).</td>

<p>The tray of the jewel case is clear, through which you can see a picture of Lauren, photographed in a similar location to the picture of Paul found on the reverse of the booklet. Next to the picture are blue outlines of 3 rectangles which can be seen even when the case is closed.</p>
