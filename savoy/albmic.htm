<br/>
<p>This 12-track album was the debut album by Savoy and was released in Norway, England, Germany, Sweden, Japan and the USA. It was released in Norway on 19th February, in the UK a week later and in Sweden on 1st March. All tracks were written by Lauren and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, produced and recorded by Savoy and mixed by Simon Vinestock (except * mixed by Rod Hui and ** mixed by Roberth Opsahl-Engen). The musicians featured on the album are Paul Waaktaar-Savoy on guitar, bass and vocal, Lauren Savoy on guitar and vocal, Frode Unneland on drums and Simone Larsen guest vocals on &quot;Velvet&quot;. The album was released on &quot;Warner Brothers&quot; label. The twelth track on the album is not actually listed on the packaging, but was listed on the promo edition as &quot;Fade&quot;.</p>

<tr><td>The USA-made CD insert features a black and white art photo of a pair of crossed legs in front of a window (by Bill Brandt from 1951). The Savoy-logo in cream colour and titles in red are printed across the middle. The insert folds out with black and white pictures of Lauren and Frode on one side and Paul on the other.</td>

In addition there are two red, orange and yellow blurred abstract shots from the &quot;Velvet&quot;-video on either side. On the side featuring the pictures of Lauren and Frode the tracks are listed across the middle in red while additional text is in white across the top. Additional black, white and red text is printed up the left hand sides of the individual shots. The other side of the insert has the album title written in large white and green letters along the bottom with white, black and red text refering to P&aring;l across the middle. The German backing insert features a red, orange and yellow picture of a hand on guitar strings (taken from the &quot;Velvet&quot; video) and the track listing in white down the left hand side. In addition there is a small and sharper inset picture of P&aring;l's guitar which also looks to be from the &quot;Velvet&quot; video.
