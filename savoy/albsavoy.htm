The cover of the album is light brown with old fashion style borders and the Savoy logo printed in large letters across the middle. In addition there are some flower designs in the bottom corners and flying birds at the top. A red and white sticker can be found on the outside wrapping of some copies of the CD, it reads &quot;includes the hit single Whalebone from the movie Hawaii Oslo + bonus DVD&quot;.
