<p>The cover of the album shows a sihouetted shot of the band standing on a jetty in front of bright yellow sunset which is reflecting on the water below. The title and Savoy logo is printed in dark red letters at the top of the sleeve. The 6 page CD booklet includes lyrics to the songs on the album, track information, two band shots and some of the artwork used on the single &quot;You Won't Come To The Party&quot;.</p>
<p>The reverse of the booklet has a shot of the empty jetty in front of the yellow sunset. On the back sleeve there is another shot of the yellow sunset over the sea, taken from the end of the jetty. A mirror image of this pictue is printed underneath the CD tray and includes a track listing of the bonus disc.</p>
<p>The disc features a brown-tone black and white picture of the band sitting on rocks in front of the water.

<p>A regular edition of the album was also available. It doesn't contain the bonus disc, but otherwise the packaging is very similar to the limited edition.</p>
<p>A third version of the album was available exclusively through <A HREF="http://www.a-ha.com" TARGET="_new">www.a-ha.com</A>. It has a slightly different cover compared to the regular release. The album title and Savoy logo have been moved from the top centre of the sleeve to the top right. Apart from that, the sleeve and booklet are almost identical to the regular release. It does not include the bonus disc and does not have a catalogue number as it was not released under the EMI label. The disc is also similar, but is more brown in colour compared to the regular edition.
