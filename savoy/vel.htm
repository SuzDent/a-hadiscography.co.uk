The cover has an orangy yellow, slightly out of focus picture of a hand on guitar strings. The reverse of the insert has an orangy yellow picture of Pal's middle, holding a guitar. The tracks are printed in light blue across the other with additional text in blue and white.</td>

<p>There are two slightly different pressings of this single, the first has the correct track order on the inner sleeve, but incorrect band list:

<p>The second print has incorrect track order (and missing track lengths) but has a more correct band list:
<br/>Velvet (album version), Velvet (Green Street Mix) October (non-LP track) Band set-up: Paul Savoy (guitar/vocals), Lauren Savoy (guitar/vocals), Frode Unneland (drums) Greg Calvert (bass)
