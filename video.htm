<H2>Hunting High And Low (1986)</H2>
<HR>
<p>The laser disc of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; has a cover just like the LP, the only difference is the text in the upper left corner: &quot;Digital sound&quot; and the upper right corner: &quot;The compact laserdisc: The Audio and Video Album&quot;. The back sleeve has the same photos as the LP whilst the index marking has 13 chapters. The first three are Take On Me, Train Of Thought and Hunting High And Low (all videos) and then comes the 10 tracks from the LP. While they are playing the screen only shows a text information on each track, no video-material. The disc has been repressed several times in the US, but is now deleted. Running Time: 50 minutes.</p>
<p>There is also a UK promotional video including these 3 videos (?) - no further details available.</p>

<HR>
<p>This promotional only video includes the making of the Japanese adverts for new make-up products &quot;Gatsby&quot; (Mandom Corporation) which feature <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> (running time: approx. 20 minutes). The adverts were made in the 109 Studios, Shibuya, Tokyo and the money from which went to &quot;Worldview International Foundation&quot;. On the front sleeve is a band shot (Morten, Mags with P&aring;l behind) dressed in white. The video comes in a side opening card box which fastens shut. The title 'Making of Gatsby - cm &quot;a-ha&quot;' is printed in dark grey letters down the left handside of the front sleeve over a pale pink background. &quot;Madom - that aura of smartness&quot; is printed in small letters in the top right hand corner with &quot;NOT FOR SALE&quot; printed in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/gatsby2.jpg" ALT="Making of Gatsby - CM a-ha video (front and back)"></p>
<p>The back sleeve features a shot of the band on set, bordered by a segment of film strip (shot 28A). Underneath, the following message is printed &quot;Dear GATSBY Fans GATSBY applauds the spirit of a-ha. Not just their phenomenal sound, but the complete concept of their lifestyles. We take greatest pleasure in presenting to you Making of GATSBY - CM &quot;a-ha&quot;. GATSBY with a-ha -- the spirited combination.&quot; The video tape is black with a light pink sticker. The title plus &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; and &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot; are printed in black text on the sticker. Additional information is printed in black at the bottom.

&nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/had_vhs3.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha VHS">
</p>
<p>The VHS includes promotional videos for the following 16 tracks:
<p>1. Take On Me
<br/>2. Cry Wolf
<br/>3. Touchy
<br/>4. You Are The One (Remix)
<br/>5. Manhattan Skyine

<br/>13. Stay On These Roads
<br/>14. Sycamore Leaves*
<br/>15. Train Of Thought
<br/>16. The Sun Always Shines On TV</p>
<p>All tracks are the regular videos used to promote the singles except * which are live recordings from the NRK TV special (1991) and &quot;There's Never A Forever Thing&quot; which is a film of the homeless directed by Lauren Savoy. Note, there was a promotional video made for &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot; (live footage taken from a 1986 US concert), but the live NRK TV version was included in place of this video. Note also the absence of videos for &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and &quot;Move To Memphis&quot;. These two tracks are included on the CD compilation, but have been replaced by &quot;There's Never A Forever Thing&quot; and &quot;Sycamore Leaves&quot; on the video compilation.</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/had_vhs2.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha VHS 2nd pressing" ALIGN="RIGHT">There was a second pressing of the VHS which is printed in a lighter blue than the first pressing. The font size on the second pressing is also slightly larger and the &quot;VHS HI-FI Stereo DOLBY STEREO&quot; white label on the side is narrower. The reverse of the insert is light blue with  picture adverts for other Warner releases, some of which differ from those on the first pressing. The white bar code label on the side of the actual video cassette is also missing.</p>
<p>The German made laserdisc (PAL system) of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines The Hits Of A-ha&quot; has a similar front and back cover to the video. The text on the front beneath the main text states: Laserdisc Digital Sound Stereo.
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/HADDVD.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha DVD"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="290" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/HADDVD2.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha DVD"></p>
<p>There is also a German made DVD of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; which again has a similar sleeve to the video release. The disc is silver with grey text. First editions come in the hard plastic transparent cases, but later pressings came in the softer plastic cases. The printing colours differ slightly. The DVD includes the extra track, the promotional video for &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; (track 18).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/had_ntsc.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha NTSC"></p>
<p>There is a German made NTSC edition of the DVD suitable for regions 3, 4 and 6. The cover is similar to the PAL release but the blue background appears to have a more textured look to it (TBC). The disc is also similar to the PAL release, but the text has been printed in a bolder font and there is no &quot;Exempt from classification&quot; text.</p>
<p>To coincide with the release of the singles collection 1984-2004, &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; was re-released with a different sleeve (early in 2005?). The content of the DVD is exactly the same as the original DVD release, but the sleeve is quite different. The top section of the sleeve is almost identical to the cover of &quot;The Singles 1984|2004&quot; / &quot;The definitive singles collection 1984-2004&quot;. The bottom section of the sleeve uses some of the artwork taken from the album booklet. There is a black strip along the bottom with a white &quot;G&quot; indicating that the content is suitable for general viewing. The DVD claims that it is suitable for regions 2 to 5 rather than 2 to 6 like the first version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/had_2004.jpg" ALT="Headlines And Deadlines - The Hits Of a-ha re-issue"></p>
<p>Two slightly different versions exist, both come with identical sleeves, but one of the discs is the regular silver DVD with black text, identical to the first release, the other is bronze coloured (this disc is copy protected - TBC). The bronze disc has the newer a-ha logo in light blue at the top with the title in gold underneath. The Warner, DVD and region logos are printed in white at the bottom of the disc and copyright information is printed in white around the edge of the disc. The &quot;bronze-edition&quot; was available as part of the Homecoming / Headlines And Deadlines two DVD set (see below) and was possibly also available separately (TBC).</p>

<p>&quot;Live in South America&quot; was also released onto VHS in Japan, it comes instead in a white cassette case rather than the standard clear one. The running format is not shown but appears to be NTSC. The artwork on it is similar to the European release but the layout on the spine is different and displays a-ha orientated rather than landscape with the title printed in Japanese. The picture of Morten holding the microphone has been cropped to show only the top half and is relocated near the top under the black &quot;WARNER MUSIC VISION&quot; logo. At the lower half of the spine, there is a brown oval with some additional Japanese white printed text. The &quot;WB&quot; logo, VHS, Catalogue number WPVP-9106 and two price tags ¥5,500 and ¥5,340 are displayed in black at the very bottom. On the back cover, the &quot;WARNER MUSIC VISION&quot; logo is slighter larger and lighter, plus the white barcode is somewhat smaller and displays a different number &quot;4 988014 591065&quot; compared to the European release. Along the bottom under the regular Copyright information, it displays that the VHS was &quot;Marketed by Warner Music Japan Inc. a Time Warner Company. Made in Japan&quot;. The usual Green &quot;UNIVERSAL Suitable for all&quot; triangular logo has not been included on this Japanese release. The Cassette tape itself is black and tan with light brownish stickered top and side labels. The top label is very similar to the European release having the title &quot;a-ha live IN SOUTH AMERICA&quot; with the full track listing printed in white underneath. The regular black and white &quot;WARNER MUSIC VISION&quot; is also included, along with a black &quot;WB&quot; logo and &quot;E EXEMPT FROM CLASSIFICATION&quot;. The Catalogue number WPVP-9106, VHS hi-fi and STEREO are shown in white. The same Copyright and Japanese Marketing information which is displayed on the back cover is also included. On the side label, there is a black &quot;WB&quot; logo at the top, with a-ha and the Japanese title printed orientated in white. The VHS and &quot;WARNER MUSIC VISION&quot; logos and Catalogue number are displayed in black at the bottom. The Video also includes an additional white folded sheet displaying the full track lyrics in both English and Japanese.</p>

<p>Text printed on the reverse of the DVD / Video:</p>
<p>&quot;The year 2000 marked the triumphant return of a-ha to the international scene. After a seven-year break, the band reformed and released the CD &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot; to widespread critical acclaim, and scored a European hit with the single &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;.</p>
<p>Having completed a successful tour of Japan and Europe, a-ha returned to their native Norway on the 24th and 25th of March 2001, for two two sell-out shows at Oslo's new football arena; Vallhall. This DVD is a recording of the first night.</p>
<p>This DVD contains lots of extra material, including documentation of their seven years apart, interviews, unreleased live footage, and 4 videos from &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Note: There is a spelling mistake on the a-ha.com release: documentation is printed incorrectly as &quot;documentatition&quot;.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="200" SRC="video/vallhall_dvd2.jpg" ALT="Homecoming - www.a-ha.com version DVD"></p>

These releases do not come with the exclusive bonus CD, but include the same bonus material. The front covers are similar to the version released via the internet, but the &quot;limited edition&quot;-circle on the DVD is replaced by the DVD trademark. There is also a blue rectangular sticker on the front with the text &quot;Features all of their greatest hits including: 'Cry Wolf' 'The Sun Always Shines On TV' 'The Living Daylights' and 'Take On Me'&quot; plus catalogue number in white.

<p>The back covers are quite different and include the track listing in two columns at the top of the sleeve. The text about the return in 2000 and concerts in 2001 is the same, but is printed right across the back sleeve. The DVD includes some format and running time information printed on black rectangular strips. There is also additional &quot;Warner Music Vision&quot;, format, &quot;Exempt from classification&quot; and copyright text on both the DVD and video sleeve.
