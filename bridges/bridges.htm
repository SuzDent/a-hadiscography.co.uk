<H2>Bridges - Fakkeltog (Summer 1980)</H2>
<HR>
<p>P&aring;l Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen's first group was called Bridges. They released a self-financed LP on the record company VÂkenatt in Norway only called "Fakkeltog" (Torch-light procession). 1000 copies were made, but very few of them sold. The music is heavily influenced and inspired by The Doors. This record is the most sought-after record among a-ha fans and you must expect to pay an awful lot of money to get your hands on a copy of this record.</p>
<p>The LP has a home-made cover design (photo by Fritz Johannesen) which shows the faces of the group members. In the background there is some text (apparently Norwegian lyrics).

<p>The back of the cover shows a field with more lyrics printed upon it. This is not the complete lyrics for the album, only drafts and excerpts. The record in itself is quite unique as it has a stop mark on side B. This is done to divide the record into the three seperate parts called "The Oncoming Of Day", "The Oncoming" and "The Oncoming Of Night". 
<p>One side of the LP has a black label with grey text listing the tracks for &quot;The Oncoming Of Night&quot;.</p> &quot;V&aring;kenatt Presenterer&quot; and &quot;Bridges...&quot; have been printed in large grey capital letters above the track list. The other side of the LP has a white disc label. The top half features red text with &quot;...Fakkeltog&quot; and track list for &quot;The Oncoming&quot;. The bottom half of the label lists the tracks for &quot;The Oncoming Of Day&quot; in black text which is printed upside down compared to the text in the top half. A black line divides the top and bottom sections of the label. </p>

<p>An even rarer edition of the LP contains a poster (around 1000 copies came with a poster - TBC?). There are two posters available;  one has lyrics to three songs printed across the groupshot while the other comes without the lyrics.</p>

<p>The album was produced by Svein Erichsen, mixed by Svein Erichsen and Tore Aarnes. It features PÂl Waaktaar on guitar and vocals, Magne Furuholmen on synthesizers, &Oslash;ystein Jevanord on drums  and percussion and Viggo Bondi on bass guitar. The track "Vagrants" features ÿivind Nusle and Hans Morten Stensland on violins, Svein Ivar Fors and Elisabeth Moe on cello, Ingvil Kaalhus on obo. "September" features Gro Hanne Fors and Sissel Gr¯nlund on tumpets. The songs, arrangements and lyrics are all by PÂl except for "Vagrants" which is arranged by Erik Nygaard. The songs on this album are all sung in English. This is the only album released by Bridges, the band started another album by the name of "Poem" but it was never published. The a-ha song "This Alone Is Love" features song text from the Bridges songs "May The Last Dance Be Mine" ("It will make my last breath pass out at dawn It will make my body dissolve out in the blue") and slightly adapted lyrics from "Every Mortal Night" ("Travel by trap-doors our souls are a myrid of wars And we are losing everyone").</p>

    <p>On 20 November 2020 &quot;Våkenatt&quot; was released on CD and LP by Korova Records. The front and back cover art of the LP is almost identical to the Rockheim release with the exception of the Korova logo plus marketing and copyright information at the bottom of the back sleeve. The sleeve is a standard gate-fold (and not the 3-fold sleeve released by Rockheim), so the centre shot has a fold at a different place. One side of the inner sleeve is the same as the Rockheim release, but the other side differs significantly. It is a similar shade of green to the Rockheim vinyl with the title in large silver letters printed down the centre, two letters on each line and fading from dark to light down the sleeve. Information about the albumand the recording is in white at the bottom. Other than the record company information, the disc labels are almost identical to the Rockheim release.
