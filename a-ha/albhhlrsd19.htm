On 13 April 2019, a special vinyl LP &quot;Hunting High And Low The Early Alternative Mixes&quot; was released to independent record stores around the world as part of the 2019 Record Store Day.
The LP has a unqiue sleeve with a black and white shot of the band (Mags, Morten, Paul) from the same photo shoot as the cover picture of the original release by Just Loomis. The a-ha logo is printed in grey in the bottom right hand corner with &quot;hunting high and low&quot; in small white font and &quot;the early alternative mixes&quot; in small red font below.</p>
<p>There is a red sticker in the top right hand corner with the text &quot;the eraly alternative mixes making their vinyl debut limited edition of 6,000 603497853427&quot; in respectively white and black font. There is also a silver stamp like sticker with perforated edges and the word &quot;EXCLUSIVE&quot; embossed down the side. The words &quot;RECORD STORE DAY&quot; are printed in black font with the O's as vinyl discs.</p>

	The reverse of the sleeve is white and designed in a similar way to the original LP. The tracks are printed in black and red typed font down the left hand side with information and copyright information in black below. On the right hand side, there are three strips of 4 black and white photos of each band member (Mags, Morten and Paul). The picure strips are made to look like kodak film, but printed as photos, rather than negatives.</p>
<p>The alternative mixes are the same as those released on disc 4 of the 30th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; (2015).</p>
