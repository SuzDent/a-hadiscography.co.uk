&quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was written as the theme song to the identically titled James Bond film. 
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td>The 7&quot;-release features three individual colour-shots of the band members (Morten, P&#0229;l &amp; Mags) by Paul Rider in the upper right corner on a bluish background. A black a-ha-logo in the shape of a gun is placed in the mid left position, while the title is written in white capital letters in the lower right corner. In addition three and a half small red &quot;bullet holes&quot; have been placed close to the gun. </td>

The reverse offers three small colour shots from the movie on the same bluish background, while the track listing has been printed in red capital letters on black strips near the upper right corner. In addition there are four more of the red &quot;bullet holes&quot;. The regular 7&quot; release offers the single version of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (4:04), written and produced by John Barry and P&#0229;l with additional production by Jason Corsaro and Mags, plus the &quot;Instrumental Version&quot; (4:40) on the flip.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td><p>In addition a limited edition fold-out copy was offered to fans. While the reverse side of the picture sleeve is identical to the regular release except that the background colour is silver rather than blue, the front is all silver. There is an a-ha gun logo in the upper left corner, while several holes have been punched through the sleeve in order to reveal the title printed in black capital letters on a red background.</td>

</TABLE>
Opening the fold-out sleeve, the three individual coloured shots have been placed on a black background in the upper left hand corner. A grey enlarged a-ha gun logo covers most of the space and the title has been printed with black capital letters on a background consisting of red drops of blood.

<p>As with many of the 7&quot; singles, there are versions available with different coloured labels including white, silver and red.</p>
<p>The 12&quot;-release presents the additional track &quot;Extended Mix&quot; (6:59) produced by Corsaro, Barry, Mags and P&#0229;l, but is otherwise similar to the 7&quot; concerning the sleeve. </p>
<p>There is also a 12&quot; limited edition 12&quot; picture disc available. This features a colour band-shot on a bluish background with the same a-ha logo and titles as the regular releases.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td>The reverse has a picture of a truck flying through the air which also functions as a background. In addition there are the same two small colour shots of the main male and female characters of the movie featured on the reverse of the 7&quot; and 12&quot;-releases placed in the lower left quarter of the record. The a-ha gun logo is light blue, while the track listing has been printed in red capital letters on black strips.</td>
