This text and WB logo are printed in lighter colours on the second pressing. The discs are the same but some(?) of the re-pressings have a different, 725733-2.4 RSA (Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf) matrix number on them, rather than the original 925 733-2 P+O-B (P+O Compact Disc GmbH &amp; Co.

The US first CD edition was released by &quot;Warner Brothers&quot; and comes with the regular artworks and colour booklet; it was &quot;Made by WEA Manufacturing&quot; and is similar to the European release. The same production and copyright information is used on the back sleeve, but it additionally shows that it was &quot;Printed in U.S.A.&quot;, unlike the European release, there is no catalogue number displayed in the top right hand corner. The actual disc is silver with black text and includes the regular layout, but comes with some additional production and copyright information displayed on the left hand side, rather than around the outer rim, it reads; &quot;(P) 1988 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S., a Warner Communications Company. All Rights Reserved. Unauthorised duplication is a violation of applicable laws. Mfg. by WEA Manufacturing&quot;.

There is another US CD pressing which was again released by &quot;Warner Brothers&quot; and comes with the same catalogue number, but the disc was instead &quot;Manufactured by Discovery Systems&quot;. The front and back cover sleeves are exactly the same as the previous US &quot;WEA Manufacturing&quot; edition, but the production and copyright information on the left hand side of the disc has been slightly amended to now read; &quot;Mfg. by Discovery Systems&quot;. The layout of the disc is otherwise exactly the same as the earlier edition with the &quot;MADE IN USA&quot; again being displayed at the bottom. The text &quot;MADE BY DISCOVERY SYSTEMS – AN AMERICAN COMPANY 2UD0100A&quot; is additionally engraved round the centre ring of the disc.</p>

The cover of this Japanese only mini album has a group studio picture with a yellow and pink title logo on a blue background. The CD insert folds out with the lyrics, and individual pictures of the 3 band members (Magne being on the back of the insert). The CD comes with a white obi strip with red, blue and black text. 
<p>The CD features a group shot as found on the UK 12&quot; picture disc of &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot;.</p>

<p>There are 2 slightly different obi-strips for this mini Japanese album. The differences are very subtle - one has three lines of text at the top of the obi, whilst the other has two. The one with 3 lines of text has 2 different prices printed at the bottom of the spine, the other has just one price. Otherwise these releases seem to be exactly the same with same catalogue numbers.
