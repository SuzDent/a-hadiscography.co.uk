<P><B>Brazil:</B> The first CD pressing in Brazil was manufactured by MICROSERVICE. Compared to the European edition, there are some minor differences, there is no bar code n the back cover and there is some Brazilian manufacturing and licensing text at the bottom. The disc is silver with black text, including some Brazilian manufacturing information at the bottom. The booklet is the same as the European release but the back cover is printed in darker blue.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG WITH="310" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/sotr_brcd.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads Brazilian CDs"></CENTER></P>
<P>The second pressing was released by Videolar under licence to Warner Music Brazil Ltda. The disc and back cover differ from the first pressing. This second pressing has a bar code on the back cover and has different manufacturing information which is black, rather than blue. The disc is silver with black text, but the black rim is missing from the second pressing, it also doesn't have serial numbers printed for each track like the first pressing. The manufacturing information again differs and the distribution information is missing. There is also a silver flapf hologram sticker on the front of the case. A second Videolar pressing exists which is similar to the first but has an ifpi silver hologram sticker and the back cover record company information differs. In addition, the Amazon flying bird logo is included on the back sleeve. The insert booklet and disc is identical to the first pressing.
</P> 
<P><IMG WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/sotrbrcas.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads Brazilian cassette (cover and cassette)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The cassette was manufactured by WEA DISCOS LTDA and differs from the European release. The front of the insert is blue with the regular artwork in the centre with a white border. The title is printed in silver capital letters above with the Dolby system logo at the bottom. The spine and back insert are orange with black text. The cassette itself is cream with brown text. On the cover, each track is listed with its nay serial number.</P> 
<P><B>Canada:</B> The Canadian CD album is similar to the European edition, but with record company information on both the sleeve and disc. The catalogue number is shorter, CD 25733. It comes with a glossier booklet than the European edition.</P>
<P><B>Germany:</B> Limited numbers of the LP came with a free band poster. It is a 55cm x 55cm black and white poster of the band members, wearing leather jackets and standing in front of an old fashioned silver microphone - the same poster which came with limited numbers of the 12&quot; single of &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;.
<P><B>Germany / E.U.:</B> There are several different German made CD pressings. The first and second pressings are very similar with slightly different copyright and record company information on the back sleeve with the information on the second pressing being slightly longer with the additional text &quot;.. Unauthorized Copying, Hiring, Lending, Public Performance And Broadcasting Of This Record Prohibited. Manufactured in Germany. Presse en Allemagne. Record Service GmbH. Alsdorf A Warner Communications Company&quot; rather than &quot;.. Unauthorised duplication is a violation of application laws.&quot;. This text and WB logo are printed in lighter colours on the second pressing. The discs are the same but some(?) of the re-pressings have a different, 725733-2.4 RSA (Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf) matrix number on them, rather than the original 925 733-2 P+O-B (P+O Compact Disc GmbH &amp; Co. KG). 
<P>The E.U. pressing is similar to the first German pressing but with a different catalogue number, the French part being WE 835 rather than the usual WE 851, and matrix number (925 733-2 P+O-C.) and the text &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; on the disc has been changed to &quot;Made In Germany&quot;. The catalogue number on the back sleeve doesn't have the word &quot;France&quot; printed before the number WE 835. Some copies come with a yellow round exclamation sticker on the front of the case. This E.U. edition is almost identical to that used in the UK except that the UK edition has the word &quot;France&quot; on the back sleeve. Another E.U. pressing is similar to the first, but has the full catalogue number, not just the second part, printed on the back of the insert booklet and on the spine. The matrix number is 759925733-2 WME, rather than the RSA one.
There is a third E.U. pressing which has a different matrix number (759925733-2.3 V01 OVB) on the disc. There are multiple pressings of this edition and the darkness of the colours differ. The track listing and WB logo are printed in black, rather than blue with different record company and copyright information stating that it is made in the E.U. The catalogue number, usually displayed in the top right hand corner of the back sleeve has been omitted. The full catalogue number is printed on the spine, rather than just the last part, but there the French number is not printed on the cover or disc.
Another E.U. copy has the full catalogue number printed on the back sleeve and disc with the French number WE 851 on the back sleeve. The matrix code is 925733-2.4 RSA.

The cover of this Japanese only mini album has a group studio picture with a yellow and pink title logo on a blue background. The CD insert folds out with the lyrics, and individual pictures of the 3 band members (Magne being on the back of the insert). The CD comes with a white obi strip with red, blue and black text. 
<P>The CD features a group shot as found on the UK 12&quot; picture disc of &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot;.</P>

<IMG WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/rcobi.jpg" ALT="Road Club Obis (slight differences)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<P>There are 2 slightly different obi-strips for this mini Japanese album. The differences are very subtle - one has three lines of text at the top of the obi, whilst the other has two. The one with 3 lines of text has 2 different prices printed at the bottom of the spine, the other has just one price. Otherwise these releases seem to be exactly the same with same catalogue numbers.
<P><B>Tracks:</B>The Blood That Moves The Body (Extended Version) (5:26) / Take On Me (Extended Version) (4:51) / Stay On These Roads (Extended Version) (6:14) / Hunting High And Low (Extended Remix) (6:03) / Soft Rains Of April (Original Mix) (3:15)</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="301" SRC="albums/otib_cd2.jpg" ALT="On Tour In Brazil CD - reverse of insert" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The CD edition is quite rare. It has a similar cover to the LP with the reverse of the front insert is similar to the fold-out card which comes with the LP. The back insert is light blue with a mirror image of the large a-ha logo used on the front sleeve on the left hand side. The track list is printed in black down the centre and there is even a gap between &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot; and &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; indicating that it uses the same artwork as the LP. The disc is plain with black text. The a-ha logo and title are at the top, with the track list on the right hand side and record company information on the left hand side.</P>
<P>There are a very limited number of test pressings which have the same catalogue number. They come with picture sleeve and fold-out poster. The disc label is almost plain white disc label with a small amount of text.</P>

The tracks are listed on the flap which folds inside the cassette box. The cassette itself is white with black text.</P>
