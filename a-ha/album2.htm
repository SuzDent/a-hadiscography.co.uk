<p>There are 2 slightly different obi-strips for this mini Japanese album. The differences are very subtle - one has three lines of text at the top of the obi, whilst the other has two. The one with 3 lines of text has 2 different prices printed at the bottom of the spine, the other has just one price. Otherwise these releases seem to be exactly the same with same catalogue numbers.

The CD edition is quite rare. It has a similar cover to the LP with the reverse of the front insert is similar to the fold-out card which comes with the LP. The back insert is light blue with a mirror image of the large a-ha logo used on the front sleeve on the left hand side. The track list is printed in black down the centre and there is even a gap between &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot; and &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; indicating that it uses the same artwork as the LP. The disc is plain with black text. The a-ha logo and title are at the top, with the track list on the right hand side and record company information on the left hand side.</p>
<p>There are a very limited number of test pressings which have the same catalogue number. They come with picture sleeve and fold-out poster. The disc label is almost plain white disc label with a small amount of text.</p>
