The inside of the album includes an insert which instead folds out (rather than being a booklet), the regular text containing the history of the band is shown, but has been condensed and printed in a smaller font size in order to cover only two sides, rather than the usual four, there is also a collage made up of Morten's, Magne's and Paul's faces on one side only (rather than one page for each band member). The full track listing has again been condensed onto one side rather than two, with the regular back page artworks showing the backs of the three band members running outdoors. The cream box displaying the names of the three band members; &quot;a-ha MORTEN HARKET VOCALS, MAGNE FURHOLMEN KEYBOARDS and PAUL WAAKTAAR-SAVOY GUITARS&quot; has now been relocated to the bottom left hand corner of the back page.

<p>There was also a Russian &quot;НИКИТИН" re-issue which comes in a jewel case with an obi strip rather than a slip-case. The Catalogue number 4607173157812 on display differs somewhat compared to that one used on the earlier Russian release. The cover is of similar design to the European release and the earlier Russian edition, but includes an additional silver &quot;WARNER MUSIC INTERNATIONAL FOR SALE IN RUSSIA&quot; hologram sticker in the top right hand corner.

The obi spine and side of the CD case comes with a similar layout to the European release which displays the regular title &quot;a-ha THE SINGLES 1984|2004&quot; in the centre, with &quot;ФИРМА ГРАМЗАПИСИ НИКТИН&quot; again shown on the left hand side (with the &quot;WARNER STRATEGIC MARKETING&quot; logo included alongside, but present only on the CD case spine).
