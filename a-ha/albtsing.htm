<H4>Russia</H4>
<p>The Russian edition comes in a card slip-case which is similar (front and back) to the regular European album. The insert which comes with the Russian edition folds out (rather than being a booklet). On the inside of the insert, there are two sides of text plus a collage made up of Morten's, Magne's and Paul's faces (rather than one page for each band member). The back of the insert is similar to the reverse of the booklet. The remaining side has the album track list on it. The Russian disc differs from the European one in that the square and triangle have been printed in silver, making them stand out much more.
