<p>On 6 October, a-ha released an unplugged album &quot;MTV Unplugged Summer Solistice&quot;. The album was recorded across two nights, Thursday 22 and Friday 23 June 2017 on the tiny island of Giske close to the city of &Aring;lesund in Norway. The shows were performed in front of an audience of 250 people.

Across the overlap of the bodies, you can see a live shot of the band taken from one of the shows. The title is printed in black letters in the bottom right hand corner of the sleeve. The booklet has eight double sided pages with lots of information about the shows printed in black on the white pages plus eight coloured shots of the band performing and one shot of the band standing with Alison Moyet, one of the artists performing with a-ha.</p>
