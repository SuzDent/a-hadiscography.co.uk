            <P><B>Tracks:</B> Take On Me (3:46) / Train Of Thought (4:11) / Hunting High And Low (3:43) / The Blue Sky (2:22) / Living A Boy's Adventure Tale (5:00) // The Sun Always Shines On T.V.

            <P>A German made special edition of the album was produced for &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; (the organisation by German Media-Corporation &quot;Bertelsmann&quot;). The LP is similar to the regular release, but the unique catalogue number and &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is printed in the top right hand corner of the reverse of the sleeve. &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is also printed on the label. It is thought that this LP might have been pressed for the UK market as the UK catalogue is also printed on the reverse of the sleeve, so too is a circled &quot;U&quot;.</P>
            <H3>Variations</H3>
            <P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="148" SRC="albums/hhalarg.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low Argentina LP" ALIGN="RIGHT">
                <B>Argentina:</B> The LP release has &quot;caza mayor y menor&quot; as the title &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; on the front cover. Note that the correct Spanish translation of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; should be &quot;Cazando por arriba y por abajo&quot; or &quot;Cazando por todas partes&quot; (thanks to Roberto Delgado) or &quot;Buscandote por todos lados&quot; (thanks to Jose Arambula). The title printed on the sleeve is a literal translation which doesn't make proper sense. The WEA logo is printed in the upper right hand corner and the cover print is darker black and white. The reverse of the sleeve and labels also have the text in Spanish e.g. &quot;Take On Me&quot; is written as &quot;tomalo por mi&quot;. The promo edition is the regular LP with a &quot;Promocional, phohibida su venta&quot; stamp.</p>
            <P>The CD edition is similar to the European release but has an &quot;ifpi&quot; hologram sticker on the front of the case and the text in the bottom left hand corner of the back sleeve is in Portuguese. The back sleeve and disc indicate that the album was published by Warner Music Argentina.</p>

The inside of the insert is white with blue text, listing the tracks in Argentinian and English. The cassette was made by &quot;EMSA&quot; and is cream with brown text. The catalogue number on this first pressing is 4-25300.</P>
            <P>The second pressing is very similar to the earlier pressing including having the same front cover artworks, but comes with a different catalogue number 90934, the &quot;DOLBY SYSTEM&quot; text has been printed much clearer on this copy. The inside of the insert is again white with blue text, it now includes some additional manufacturing information printed in Spanish on the inside of the back cover which reads &quot;Fabricado y distribuido por EMI ODEON S.A.I.C.

The front cover artworks is the same, but the inside of the insert is now printed with black text instead of the usual blue which was used on the earlier pressings. The information is however exactly the same including the additional &quot;EMI&quot; manufacturing information. The tape is again coloured white, although there appears to be two slightly different issues of it, some copies come with blue printed text, whilst others have brown printed text. The information and layout is however exactly the same on both.

                <HR>
                <P>This Japanese only mini album is available on 12&quot; vinyl EP, cassette and CD. The cover (front and reverse) is similar to the cover of the USA 12&quot; of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot;.
                    There were at least two pressings of the CD edition. The only difference between the sleeves seems to be a barcode printed in the top left corner of the reverse of the first pressing and the different catalogue numbers.
                </P>
                <p style="text-align:center;"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="133" SRC="albums/45rpm2.jpg" ALT="45 R.P.M. Club CD - 1st Pressing with Obi"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/45rpm.jpg" ALT="45 R.P.M. Club CD - 2nd Pressing"></p>
                <P>The first issue comes with a red `sticker' obi strip with white a-ha-logo and text whilst the second pressing has a more regular blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; paper obi strip.

                    There are two slightly different &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; obi strips. They seem to be the same from the front, but the position of the obi-strip and catalogue number differs on the reverse.</P>
                <P>The CD has a 6 page booklet with lyrics and individual factfiles (in Japanese) plus colour pictures. The reverse of the booklet is khaki coloured with a colour group shot. The back insert has an a-ha logo with small individual pictures inside the letters. The CD is gold coloured with black titles, a red rim and Warner Brothers logo.</P>
                <P>There are also at least 2 different pressings of the EP. The covers are similar to the CD release and come with obi-strips.

                    The obi-strips differ slightly, the first (catalogue no. P-6228) is a similar colour to the bottom section of the album sleeve with text in red, black and white. The bands faces are printed within the letters of the a-ha logo. The reverse of the obi features 2 colour shots of each of the band members.
                <P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="50" SRC="albums/45epobi2.jpg" ALT="45 R.P.M. Club EP - 2nd Pressing Obi (front and reverse)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
                    The second obi (catalogue no. P-6238) is light grey with red, black and white text. The a-ha logo is black and doesn't have band pictures printed within the letters. The reverse of the obi has pictures of the &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; and &quot;45 R.P.M.&quot; covers, information plus the Japanese tour dates. All text is in Japanese.
                <P>The cassette has a yellow cover with one red spine and one yellow spine. The same picture as used on the LP and CD is positioned at the top of the sleeve with a large red logo below and other black text.
                <table border="0">
                    <tr><td>The 'main' red spine has yellow titles where as the second spine includes a smaller version of the cover picture and titles in red and black.</td>

<p>The 'reverse cover' is also yellow with black and blue text.</p>
<P>The four tracks on this mini album include the extended version of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; (8:27) remixed by Steve Thompson, &quot;Driftwood&quot; (3:06), the extended version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; (4:49) and the instrumental of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; (6:38). The Japanese 12&quot; comes with an obi strip and gatefold 12&quot; colour photo insert.</P>

        The cover of this Japanese only mini album is similar to that of &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; single (front and back). It is available on CD, 12&quot; and cassette.
    <P>Again there were two pressings of the CD issue. The first pressing has a barcode printed in the top left corner of the reverse sleeve and a different catalogue number from the 2nd pressing. The first pressing
        <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/ticdisc.jpg" ALT="Twelve Ihch Club - 1st pressing disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
        also comes with a white stickered obi strip with red a-ha-logo and text whilst the reissue comes with a blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; paper obi.
    <P>Some (if not all?) of the first pressing have the title spelt incorrectly on the disc as &quot;Twelve Ihch Club&quot;.</P>
    <P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/tic.jpg" ALT="Twelve Inch Club - 2nd Pressing" ALIGN="RIGHT">
        The CD booklet has 4 grey coloured pages with lyrics, a black and white group picture plus 3 individual pictures. The back of the booklet is similar to the back of the CD, but without the track listing. The label is &quot;Reprise Records&quot;.
        The CD is gold like the 45 R.P.M, but with a red &quot;Reprise Records&quot; logo.</P>
