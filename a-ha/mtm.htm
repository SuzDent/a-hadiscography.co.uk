<tr><td>&quot;Move To Memphis&quot; was recorded especially for inclusion on and to promote the &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot;-album. The tune was produced by a-ha and is different from the version later to be included on the &quot;Memorial Beach&quot;-album. The 7&quot; picture sleeve offers a black and white band-shot (Morten, P&#0229;l and Mags) by Just Loomis. A white a-ha logo is placed in the upper left corner with &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; printed in orange capital letters right below it.</td>

The reverse features track listings and additional information in light blue, orange and white letters of various sizes in the top left corner of an otherwise black sleeve. In addition to the self-produced single (4:15) the flip contains a live version of &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; (4:46) recorded especially for the NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation)-produced show &quot;&yuml;sten For Sol Vesten For M&ahat;ne&quot; (East Of The Sun West Of The Moon).

There is also a Special DJ Edit promo 7&quot; which features an edit version of &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; (4:03).

The disc stickers are the same as the regular release and list the track time of &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; as 4:15, but the running time is actually only 4:03. The disc itself has the catalogue number &quot;W0070 DJ&quot; etched into it.</P>
<P>The 12&quot; is identical to the 7&quot;-release concerning the front of the sleeve. The reverse features the necessary adjustments made for the additional tracks. These include the &quot;Extended Version&quot; of &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; (6:09) and live versions of &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot; (4:57), &quot;East Of The Sun&quot; (4:11) and &quot;(Seemingly) Nonstop July&quot; (3:00) recorded live for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK).</P>
