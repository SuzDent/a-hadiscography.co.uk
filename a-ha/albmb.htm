<HR>
<p>This 10-track album was written by P&aring;l Waaktaar, except &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; by P&aring;l and Magne Furuholmen and &quot;Lamb To The Slaughter&quot; by Magne. The album was produced by David Z and a-ha and mixed by Rod Hui with P&aring;l Waaktaar. It features Morten on vocals, Magne on keyboards, P&aring;l on guitar, J.B. B&oslash;geberg on bass, Per Hillestad on drums and JD Steele, Jevetta Steele and Kathy Wilson on backing vocals on &quot;Lie Down In Darkness&quot; and &quot;Move To Memphis&quot;. This German made album was available in many European countries.</p>
<p>The cover of the LP features a large red and orange a-ha-logo which appears to be glowing through the undergrowth. Underneath there is a colour-shot by Just Loomis of a-ha standing on a beach (P&aring;l, Morten and Magne). The title is written in small white letters at the top. The reverse of the LP features more of the red and black 'undergrowth' with a black and white shot of the band in the bottom section (Magne, Morten and Paul - similar to that on &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body '92&quot; single). The tracks are listed in white above the picture. It comes with an inner sheet with a large black and white a-ha picture and the lyrics on the back. The LP version of the album was not available in the UK but could be imported from Germany.</p>
