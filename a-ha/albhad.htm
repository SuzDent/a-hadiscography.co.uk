The &quot;Warner Music Europe&quot; Logo has also been inscribed onto the silver centre ring of the disc and the Matrix coding has now been changed to 759926773-2.3 06/99.</p>

It is not thought that this pressing was used for the general release in the UK as it seems rather scarce. This 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 833 edition is very similar to the earlier 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852 first release which includes the same disc which is navy with beige text and comes without the outer silver rim on the edge of the disc. it also includes the same matrix coding reference 759926773-2 WME.

<p>There is a regular French CD release of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; which comes with the same front and back cover artworks to the European pressings, but the Catalogue number 7599-26773-2 FRANCE: WE 391 on the back cover and disc has changed. The disc also additionally includes the word &quot;FRANCE&quot; which doesn't appear on the European discs. The white barcode on the back cover is also slightly smaller compared to the European release, it also includes the same European CD booklet. The Manufacturing and Copyright information is exactly the same as the European release and reads &quot;THIS COMPILATION (P) 1991 WEA INTERNATIONAL INC. (C) 1991 WEA INTERNATIONAL INC.

A TIME WARNER COMPANY MADE IN GERMANY BY WARNER MUSIC MANUFACTURING EUROPE UNAUTHORISED COPYING, HIRING, LENDING, PUBLIC PERFORANCES OR BROADCASTING OF THIS RECORD PROHIBITED&quot;. The disc itself is Navy and the a-ha logo at the top is coloured cream, the remainder of the text is displayed in silver. There is an outer rim to the disc which is clear rather than silver which appears on some of the later European pressings of the same album. The layout is vertually the same as the earlier European pressings including the track listing down the right hand side and the Catalogue number, Manufacturing information and &quot;Warner Brothers Records/COMPACT disc DIGITAL AUDIO&quot; logo's on the left hand side. The usual Copyright information which appears around the bottom edge of the disc has been omitted from this French pressing.</p>  

<p>In 1996, the album was rereleased in the same case, but slipped inside a unique white carton sleeve sponsored by NRJ radio. On the spine and cover of the sleeve it calls the album &quot;Best Of a-ha&quot;. On the front of the sleeve there is a group shot (P&aring;l, Morten and Mags) in the centre. There is something a little bit stange about this photo as Morten has bright green eyes rather than his normal blue ones! The edition inside the slipcase is almost identical to the European 
FRANCE WE 852, 7599267773-2.2 WME edition, but the silver ring around the edge of the disc is thinner, and the track listing displayed on the right hand side of the disc is slightly smaller.</p>

An additional &quot;Warner Music&quot; silver logo has also been added on the clear centre part, in-between both cogs to each side.
