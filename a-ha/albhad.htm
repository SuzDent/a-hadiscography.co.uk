<p>The Chilean CD album comes with a different font to both the a-ha logo and title &quot;HEADLINES AND DEADLINES THE HITS OF A-HA&quot; on the front cover and disc, some of the text printed inside the CD booklet has also been printed larger compared to the European release.

	<p>The Chilean cassette release of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; comes with a different layout and design compared to the European release. The front cover comes with the usual album artworks but printed in the centre with a white strip shown at both the top and bottom. The a-ha logo and title has been printed in the three usual colours beige, blue and white. The spine has a white background and displays the title &quot;a-ha&quot; in black, &quot;HEADLINES &amp; DEADLINES&quot; in blue and &quot;THE HITS OF A-HA&quot; again in black. The &quot;WB&quot; logo, &quot;DOLBY&quot; logo, Catalogue number 198027 and &quot;STEREO&quot; are also shown in black. On the back cover which is also coloured white, we have the full track listing printed in English, side 1 and side 2 are shown in Spanish as LADO 1 And LADO 2. There is also some &quot;DOLBY&quot; information which has also been printed in Spanish. On the inside of the insert which is white with black text, the full track listing is shown on the left hand side all in English along with some production information, track lengths and track credits.

On the back sleeve at the top left hand corner the &quot;Popron&quot;logo is printed in black letters on a white background with the coding 50 153-2 displayed underneath, the rest of the sleeve is otherwise of a similar design to the original European release which includes the same Catalogue number 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852. The disc itself is also navy with beige text, on the upper left hand side it additionally displays &quot;popron&quot;, along with the coding 50 153-2 and &quot;MADE IN CSFR&quot;. The Record Company information on the left hand side has also been amended to omit the text; &quot;MADE IN GERMANY BY WARNER MUSIC MANUFACTURING EUROPE&quot;, plus the regular &quot;GEMA/BIEM&quot; logo has been replaced instead with an &quot;OSA&quot; logo. Some pressings of the disc come with a large centre silver ring whilst others use the more standard clear plastic ring. The matrix coding on both discs is however the same; &quot;GZ CC1014 50 153-2&quot;.</p>

The usual CD booklet is also included. The disc is again navy with beige text but now includes an outer silver ring to it which doesn't appear on the first issue.

Additionally displayed on the front cover of the CD case is a round yellow sticker with a white ! sign. The same usual CD booklet is also included. The disc is again navy and includes an outer silver rim to the disc, but the text has now been printed in cream (rather than beige), making it much more clearer. Also the track listing displayed on the right hand side is somewhat smaller compared to the earlier 7599-26773-2 FRANCE 852 pressings. The &quot;Warner Music Europe&quot; Logo has also been inscribed onto the silver centre ring of the disc and the Matrix coding has now been changed to 759926773-2.3 06/99.</p>

<p>There is another European made CD release of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; which comes with another different Catalogue number 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 833 on the back cover compared to the regular 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852 and reissue 7599-26773-2 WE 835 European editions. It is not thought that this pressing was used for the general release in the UK as it seems rather scarce. This 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 833 edition is very similar to the earlier 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852 first release which includes the same disc which is navy with beige text and comes without the outer silver rim on the edge of the disc. it also includes the same matrix coding reference 759926773-2 WME. The Manufacturing information also displays that it was &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Warner Music Manufacturing Europe&quot;, it also comes with the same front and back cover artworks and includes the 6 page CD booklet.</p>
<p>The compilation album &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; was re-released onto LP by &quot;Rhino Entertainment Company&quot; for the sale in the E.U. on the 8th June 2018, it includes the same front cover featuring the original colour 1991 group-shot of Morten, Magne and Pal by Just Loomis. The a-ha logo has again been printed in beige at the bottom right-hand with the title &quot;HEADLINES AND DEADLINES&quot; in blue and &quot;THE HITS OF A-HA&quot; in white underneath. The reverse of the sleeve also has a similar layout to the original release containing a black background with the same track listing in varied font sized lettering and printed in the beige, blue and white colouring down the left-hand side. The picture of a-ha in the bottom right-hand corner taken from the &quot;Move To Memphis&quot; single is also included. At the top left-hand side of the back sleeve, above the track listing is a white barcode, but coming with a slightly different layout and revised number &quot;0 603497 860173&quot;. Unlike the original release, the UK, German and French Catalogue numbers are not present, nor is the LC 0393 coding or mini &quot;WB RECORDS®&quot; logo located in the bottom left-hand corner under the track listing. The manufacturing and copyright information is different compared to the original release; &quot;THE COPYRIGHT IN THIS SOUND RECORDING AND ARTWORK IS OWNED BY WEA INTERNATIONAL INC. THIS COMPILATION ℗&© 2018, 1991 WARNER BROS. RECORDS INC. MANUFACTURED FOR & MARKETED BY RHINO ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, A WARNER MUSIC GROUP COMPANY, 3400 W.OLIVE AVE., BURBANK, CA 91505-4614. UNAUTHORIZED DUPLICATION IS A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS. MADE IN THE E.U.&quot; The text also no longer includes the information; &quot;ALSO AVAILABLE: HEADLINES AND DEADLINES THE HITS OF A-HA VIDEO COLLECTION&quot; which appeared on the original 1991 LP edition.</p>
<p>The record itself comes with white labels and black printed text, and has a similar layout including font size of text to the original release, although with some slight differences. The regular colour &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo is included at the top of each side with the title &quot;A-HA HEADLINES & DEADLINES – THE HITS OF A-HA&quot; underneath. On the left-hand side, the word &quot;STEREO&quot;&quot; is included, along with a GEMA / MCPS&quot;&quot; squared symbol, which replaces the previous GEMA / BIEM&quot; symbol, which appeared on the original edition. The side reference is located on the right-hand side, but now printed as &quot;A SIDE&quot; or &quot;B SIDE&quot; instead of &quot;SIDE ONE&quot; or &quot;SIDE TWO&quot;. The full track listing is included at the lower half of each label, and set out in the same way as the original edition to include track credits and track lengths. The original record company production and copyright information; &quot;This compilation ℗ & © 1991 Warner Bros.

<p>There is a regular French CD release of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; which comes with the same front and back cover artworks to the European pressings, but the Catalogue number 7599-26773-2 FRANCE: WE 391 on the back cover and disc has changed. The disc also additionally includes the word &quot;FRANCE&quot; which doesn't appear on the European discs. The white barcode on the back cover is also slightly smaller compared to the European release, it also includes the same European CD booklet. The Manufacturing and Copyright information is exactly the same as the European release and reads &quot;THIS COMPILATION (P) 1991 WEA INTERNATIONAL INC. (C) 1991 WEA INTERNATIONAL INC. THE COPYRIGHT IN THIS SOUND RECORDING AND ARTWORK IS OWNED BY WEA INTERNATIONAL INC. A TIME WARNER COMPANY MADE IN GERMANY BY WARNER MUSIC MANUFACTURING EUROPE UNAUTHORISED COPYING, HIRING, LENDING, PUBLIC PERFORANCES OR BROADCASTING OF THIS RECORD PROHIBITED&quot;. The disc itself is Navy and the a-ha logo at the top is coloured cream, the remainder of the text is displayed in silver. There is an outer rim to the disc which is clear rather than silver which appears on some of the later European pressings of the same album. The layout is vertually the same as the earlier European pressings including the track listing down the right hand side and the Catalogue number, Manufacturing information and &quot;Warner Brothers Records/COMPACT disc DIGITAL AUDIO&quot; logo's on the left hand side. The usual Copyright information which appears around the bottom edge of the disc has been omitted from this French pressing.</p>  

<p>In 1996, the album was rereleased in the same case, but slipped inside a unique white carton sleeve sponsored by NRJ radio. On the spine and cover of the sleeve it calls the album &quot;Best Of a-ha&quot;. On the front of the sleeve there is a group shot (P&aring;l, Morten and Mags) in the centre. There is something a little bit stange about this photo as Morten has bright green eyes rather than his normal blue ones! The edition inside the slipcase is almost identical to the European 
FRANCE WE 852, 7599267773-2.2 WME edition, but the silver ring around the edge of the disc is thinner, and the track listing displayed on the right hand side of the disc is slightly smaller.</p>

<p>
There is another French slip-case version of &quot;Headlines and Deadlines&quot;. The cover is black with a thick red sripe along the bottom. A picture of the regular album cover with a thin white border is printed in the bottom right section. The title &quot; best of A-ha&quot; is printed in large white letters top left with a red star behind.</p>

One copy comes with a &quot;MGA Records Co Ltd / Warner Music International&quot; black, blue and white sticker, with a price tag of &quot;90 Thai Baht&quot; and some other Thai text along the bottom, whilst another &quot;MGA Records Co Ltd&quot; edition is instead mainly light blue, rather than the previously black, and comes with a different layout and design to show most of the text in Thai along the top and the &quot;MGA Records Co Ltd&quot; logo along the bottom. A smaller blue &quot;Warner Music International&quot; logo and blue &quot;90 Thai Baht&quot; price tag are included in the middle. The actual tape included on the second & third pressings is now tranparent clear with a grey centre piece and white printed text, the layout and design including the font size of the text is however the same as the earlier grey coloured cassette, but the wording &quot;JAPAN&quot; hasn’t been engraved onto the actual tape though. The Catalogue number on the cassette is also the same as before and has been shorted to &quot;26773-4&quot;.</p>

Along the bottom of the back cover under the track listing is some Production and Copyright information which reads &quot;(P) & © 1991 WEA International Inc. WEA International Inc.
