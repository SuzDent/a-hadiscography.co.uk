<P>There are several other single releases which have been listed but due to limited information or lack of catalogue numbers, I have decided not to list them in the main section. Some of these releases, like the Polish `postcard' records I believe to be unofficial releases. However, these items are listed here for the sake of completeness. If you can confirm existance of any of these releases or you know of any single releases which I have failed to list, please drop me (Suzie) an e-mail to suzie at a-hadiscography.co.uk. Please note that `country' refers to the country of manufacture rather than country of distribution unless the release has been specifically manufactured in one country for sole distribution in another. More information on identifying country of manufacture can be found <A HREF="http://www.darsu.btinternet.co.uk/discography/world.htm">here</A>.</P>
