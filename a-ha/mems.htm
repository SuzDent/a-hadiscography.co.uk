<p>The cover shows a bright blue sky with the top of a house and trees disappearing off the bottom of the sleeve. a-ha and the title are printed towards the top of the sleeve in a large white font. The reverse of the sleeve also shows a blue sky, with the end of an areoplane wing on the left hand side. The track list and production details are listed in white down the centre.</p>
<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/memsdisc.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<p>The actual disc is royal blue in colour with a white silhouette of the aeroplane wing on the left hand side. a-ha and the title are printed in white letters at the top of the disc, while the track listing is printed at the bottom. Additional white text is printed on the right hand side and around the circumference of the disc.</p>
<p>A slightly different packaged CD was available in Germany (perhaps a second pressing?) which has a similar sleeve to the first, but with the additional text &quot;Incl. Remixes by Ian Pooley, ATB and others&quot; below the title on the front.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD>There are also differences on the reverse of the sleeve, the additional text &quot;the official a-ha website: www.a-ha.com&quot; has been printed below the track information and the catalogue number is in the top right hand corner rather than the bottom right. The discs appear to be the same.</p></TD>

<p>In Germany, there was also a limited edition CD-single release which includes an enhanced track - the video for &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;. It states that the enhanced track is in &quot;Quick Time&quot; format, but it is actually an MPEG file. This file will, however, play on latest versions of the QuickTime player.</p>
<p>The cover of the limited edition CD-single is similar to the `second' regular version mentioned above, but in the top right hand section of the front sleeve is a white rectangle with the text &quot;limited edition incl. VIDEO &raquo;summer moved on&laquo; 8573 84124-2&quot;. The reverse of the sleeve includes additional details of the bonus track &quot;summer moved on (Quick Time Movie // CD-Rom)&quot;, designed by Inventive Media ANS. Apart from the extra track listed on the disc, it is otherwise much the same as the disc of the regular release.</p>

<p>The cover of the 12&quot; is similar to the CD sleeve (front and reverse) but with the additional text &quot;Incl. Remixes by Ian Pooley, ATB &amp; Pumpin' Dolls&quot; under the title on the front and the obvious differences in track listings on the reverse.</p>

<p>The disc comes with picture labels. The label on side 1, the &quot;earth | side&quot;, is similar to the front cover of the sleeve. The track listing is printed over the picture, above the `house top' and &quot;earth | side&quot; printed above the centre on the right hand side. On side 2, the &quot;Sky | side&quot; is the aeroplane wing found on the reverse of the sleeve. The titles are printed over the picture in a similar fashion to side 1, but there is additional production information at the bottom. Note that this 12&quot; plays at 33rpm.</p>
