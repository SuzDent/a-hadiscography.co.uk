  The 7&quot; release of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; features a shady group-shot (Magne, Morten and P&#0229;l) by Jonathan Lennard. In the lower left corner, a black a-ha-logo is printed on the image of a light brown piece of paper that seemingly is attached to the background by two pieces of beige tape. The song title is written in white across the top part of the sleeve.</p>
<p>The background of the reverse is white and light `brown paper' effect (the brown covers just over half of the sleeve), and the effect of using tape as an adhesive is repeated by placing a beige piece of tape on the mid right side. All information is written in black letters, and a small picture of the &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; album is placed in the lower middle position.</p>
<p>The 7&quot; version of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; is slightly edited (4:42) and some sounds are different. This is fairly obvious at the beginning, just a second before Morten starts to sing &quot;I reached inside myself..&quot;. The flip of this single release is the non-album track &quot;Driftwood&quot; (2:58) produced by a-ha. The 7&quot; is available with different coloured labels including white, silver, blue and also <NOBR>copie(s)</NOBR> exisit which in error do not have a label at all!</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/tspic7.jpg" ALT="The Sun Always Shines On T.V. UK 7&quot; Picture Disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
  Also available is a limited edition (12,000 copies pressed) sun-shaped picture disc featuring the same track listing as the regular release. The disc has individual pictures of the band members in the middle of the red, yellow and orange sun-image. The reverse is red with all information in yellow letters.</p>
<p>In order for the release to be complete the original 10&quot; PVC sleeve and &quot;a-ha The Sun Always Shines On TV W8846P&quot;-sticker should both be intact. A tasty collectors item is the extremely limited edition uncut disc which offers neither official PVC or sticker, but actually is a 12&quot;-sized jewel of an item for the fortunate few.

<p>Last, and this time least, is a 7&quot; square flexi disc with an introduction by a-ha followed by the &quot;U.S. Dance Mix&quot; of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; (4:33). The disc which offers a yellow and orange sun-image plus individual pictures of the band members features black and pink titles.</p>

<p>The disc came free with the 29th March '86 issue of the English music magazine &quot;No. 1&quot;. The previous week the same magazine offered a 7&quot;-sized 6-page booklet &quot;a-ha person 2 person&quot; featuring answers to questions and additional information on the band members.</p>
<p>The cover of the UK 12&quot; is the same as the 7&quot; except that it mentions the extended version and the b-side on both front and reverse. There are two different UK 12&quot; releases available of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot;-single. However the difference can not be detected by just looking at the cover. Some copies come with a &quot;U.S. Steve Thompson Dance Mix&quot;-sticker but not even this detail gives away the difference. When listening to and measuring the times of the tracks the differences become evident. While the so called &quot;U.S. Steve Thompson Dance Mix&quot; (8:25) starts off with a percussion drum beat (grooves finish approx. 1.5cm from record centre), the shorter extended version (7:09) which is the rarer one, features a slow piano intro. before the steady drum beat commences (grooves finish approx. 2.5cm from centre of record).</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="207" SRC="singles/tsasotv_poster.jpg" ALT="The Sun... 12&quot; poster" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Some of the 12&quot;-releases [the rarer 7:09 edition - TBC] come with a limited edition poster featuring a multicolour group-shot (Morten, Magne and P&#0229;l from left to right pictured in full length) by Robert Erdmann. The 24&quot;x36&quot; poster promotes the &quot;hunting high and low&quot;-album in white letters and larger a-ha logo in red.</p>
<p>There is a UK DJ promo 7&quot; which comes in a brown WB sleeve. Side 1 features the Radio Edit, side 2 features the 7&quot; edit.</p>
    <p>There is a mis-press Madonna release of &quot;Borderline&quot; which has a-ha's &quot;Driftwood&quot; recorded on the B-side rather than the correct B-side &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;. The labels state that the disc plays Madonna on both sides, but the give-away is the a-ha catalogue number &quot;W8846-B&quot; scratched into the vinyl on the B-side.</p>

<p>The 12&quot; is quite different from the UK release. The front has a beige background on which the same group-shot is placed. The black a-ha-logo is placed on the beige background along with the title of the song. The a-ha-logo has been underlined with a red crayon and another piece tape has been placed next to the logo. In addition a small red, white and blue Norwegian flag has been included in the lower right hand corner. The &quot;piece of tape&quot; on the back of the sleeve is smaller and on the left hand side rather than the right, the `brown paper' used is of a slightly different style, covering nearer 3/4 of the sleeve and the album picture has been omitted. The 12&quot; includes an additional track, the &quot;Instrumental Version&quot; of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; (6:40) (note: track length quoted incorrectly as 5:46 on the sleeve).</p>

<p>The front of the picture sleeve of the 7&quot; differs only slightly from the UK release in that the writing of the title &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; is more compressed, also the sleeve is textured. However, the reverse varies considerably with its grey background, light grey piece of tape, no picture and finally, mentioning of only the title track. The front cover of the 12&quot; is the same as the UK release except for the fact that &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot; is the only track mentioned, plus the type of letters used are slightly different. The reverse of the picture sleeve is similar to the German edition except for the fact that there is a grey background for the information of the track listings. This grey background covers more than 2/3 of the reverse while the rest is white. In addition there is a 1/2 centimetre white strip at the very bottom of the sleeve on which the country of origin is printed. The tracks are the same as on the German release.</p>
