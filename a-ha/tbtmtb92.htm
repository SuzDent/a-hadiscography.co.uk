The cassette single has a sleeve design very similar to the 7&quot; except for the title which has been written in two lines rather than one due to the narrower sleeve. The flap of the insert opens up and is similar to the reverse of the 7&quot; except that the design is rotated so that the &quot;h&quot; is upside down. A picture of the &quot;Headlines and Deadlines&quot;-album is printed at the top. The spine has the &quot;brown paper&quot; effect with the titles printed in different colours as on the front. The black cassette with white titles which features the same tracks as the 7&quot; has one track on each side.</P>
