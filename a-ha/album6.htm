<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hcisreg.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head - a-ha live" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<p>a-ha released their first live album on 24th March 2003 in Germany, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Holland, Spain and Sweden. The album was also released in Belgium (25th March), France (25th March) and Switzerland (21st March). The title of the live album is a line from a-ha's song &quot;The Swing Of Things&quot;. It was recorded during the 2002 &quot;Lifelines&quot; world tour and is completely live with no over-dubs. The last 6 weeks of the tour were recorded and the best quality recordings were chosen (see below for details).

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="134" SRC="albums/hcisdp1.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head - a-ha live (Digi-pak)" ALIGN="RIGHT">

There were three different versions of the album released. The regular release is a single 14-track CD. There were also two double versions which contain the regular album plus a bonus disc with 6 live tracks and behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Lauren Savoy (approx. 9 minutes long). One of the double albums came in a limited edition digi-pak with a poster.</p>

<p>The cover of the album features a photograph of a seal in water by photographer Per Maning. &quot;How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head&quot; is printed in white capital letters along the top of the sleeve, with &quot;a-ha&quot; and &quot;live&quot; in respectively red and black letters.</p>

<p>On the outer wrapping of the digi-pak, there is a red sticker with the text &quot;a-ha ALL THE HITS LIVE feat The Sun Always Shines On TV, Summer Moved On, Forever Not Yours, Take On Me, Inc. Poster&quot;. There is also a sticker indicating that the CD is copy protected. The digi-pak folds out both sides to reveal the 2 CDs in the centre. Behind the CDs is a live shot of the band on stage at Ullevaal in Oslo (taken from the back of the stage, behind Magne) and the crowd which can be seen in part through the transparent CD trays.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="472" HEIGHT="100" SRC="albums/hcisdp2.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head - a-ha live (digi-pak with discs)"></p>

The CDs feature a shot of grey water with the title printed in white, red and black. Both ends of the digi-pak have been left open: one holds 8 page booklet with live shots from the tour plus individual portrait pictures of the band members. Quotes taken from the song &quot;The Swing Of Things&quot; have been printed across the pictures in various colours. Towards the back of the booklet, the track details are printed in white.

<p>The other end of the digi-pak houses a 24cm x 36cm mini double sided poster. One side features another shot of the band on stage in Oslo (again taken from the back of the stage behind Magne. The other side shows a closer shot of Morten on stage at Ullevaal, Oslo.

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="134" SRC="albums/hcis_reg.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head - a-ha live (regular single)" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<p>The regular double album comes in a slim-line jewelcase. Some of the jewelcases come with a red sticker similar to that found on the digipak, but without the text relating to the free poster. There is also a &quot;Copy Protected sticker&quot;. The CD booklet, discs and back sleeve are similar to that of the digipak release, but there is no free poster included.</p>

<p>The regular single album has similar packaging compared to the double album, but doesn't include the second bonus disc.</p>

<p>The album was mixed by Michael Brauer in New York and mastered by George Marino. The backing band present on this album are: Anneli Drecker on backing vocals, Sven Lindvall on bass, Per Lindvall on drums and Christer Karlsson on keyboards. The live version of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; will be released as a single. Click <A HREF="tslive.htm">here</A> for more information.</p>

The catalogue number and promo details are in black and white letters on respectively white and black strips. The back sleeve is of similar design to the front, but with the tracks listed in black letters in the bottom section. The discs are of similar design to the cover: the bottom section is blue with black text and the top section has small blue WEA-logos on a silver background. This promo CD was made in Germany, but was produced for the Norwegian market. The promo album does not include the video track and is copy protected - will not play on computers.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;Did Anyone Approach You?&quot; is listed without the ? at the end, &quot;The Swing of Things&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; are listed without &quot;The&quot; at the beginning and &quot;Time &amp; Again&quot; is listed as &quot;Time And Again&quot;.</p>

<p>There is also a double Norwegian promo album which comes in a black and white text printed sleeve. The tracks are printed down the centre of the sleeve with the wea logo in the top right hand corner. At the bottom of the sleeve is the text &quot;Safety copy for promotional use only&quot;. The track list is printed in the same way as that on the blue and white promo except that &quot;Minor Earth, Major Sky&quot; is printed incorrectly as &quot;Minor Earth, Mayor Sky&quot;.</p>

<H3>Variations</H3>

<p><B>Bulgaria:</B> There is a Bulgarian cassette album of &quot;How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head&quot;. It comes with a long fold-out sleeve. There is a silver hologram sticker in the bottom right hand corner of the front sleeve. The cassette was manufactured by Orpheus Music, a Warner Music International Licensee in Germany. The front of the insert includes a shot of an empty concert hall plus a close-up of Morten with the text &quot;Oh, But How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head&quot; in white and yellow. Next to this is a shot of the stage plus a close-up of Paul with the text &quot;With An Ocean Between Us And Room In My Bed&quot; in light blue and white.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="163" SRC="albums/hcis_bulcas.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head Bulgarian cassette"></p>

<p>The reverse of the sleeve includes the album credits next to a shot of a seal underwater. Next to this is a shot of the band members on stage with the text &quot;Oh, Have I Come To The Point Where I'm Losing The Grip&quot; in bright blue and white. On the right of this, there is a shot of an outdoor arena filling with people, a close-up of Magne plus the text &quot;Or Is It Still Time To Get Into The Swing Of&quot; in yellow and white. The cassette itself is transparent with white text.</p>

<p><IMG WIDTH= "150" HEIGHT="60" SRC="albums/hcis_fr.jpg" ALT="How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head French sticker" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<B>France:</B> Some copies of the European album sold in France come with a large red &quot;RTL2&quot; sticker with the title in white at the top and the words &quot;Tous leers tubes inclus&quot; below in black and three of the tracks listed in white. The sticker goes right the way across the front of the disc. 




<p><B>Moldova:</B> The CD available in Moldova had a spelling mistake on the cover. The title is written incorrectly as &quot;Nhow Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head&quot;. There is a different live shot of the band on the reverse sleeve which has pink lighting in the foreground. The font used also differs - white text with a black outline. It is thought that this release may be unofficial.</p>
