<H2>2 CD Originaux - Hunting High And Low + Stay On These Roads</H2>
<HR>
<p>This French release features the albums &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; and &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;, it was marketed by &quot;WARNER STATEGIC MARKETING FRANCE&quot;. The front cover of this cardboard slipcase is beige with a red strip down the left hand side. &quot;A-HA&quot; is printed in large black letters at the top of the sleeve with the pictures of the album covers below and titles again in large black lettering along the bottom. &quot;Coffret 2 CD Originaux&quot; is printed on the red strip in beige and white text and includes some images of silver Compact discs above.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="335" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhlsotrfr.jpg" ALT="2 CD Originaux"></p>
	<p>The back sleeve is of similar colour design except that the red strip is on the right hand side. Some very small black text &quot;conception graphique NOC nuit de chine&quot; is displayed down the side of the red spine, which refers to where the slipcase was printed. There is some other information about the band's career all displayed in french at the top of the sleeve; &quot;Au début des années 1980, Pal Waaktaar et Magne Furuholmen, ex-membres de Bridges, créent un nouveau groupe, A-Ha, bientot rejoint par Morten Harket. En moins de trois ans, ils classent leur titre Take On Me, extrait de l'album Hunting High And Low, n° 2 des charts britanniques, largement aidés par un vidéo-clip trés original mélant dessins et scénes réelles.
Les Etats-Unis aussi leur font les yeux doux, suivis par le monde entier, et un autre titre de l'album, The Sun Always Shines On TV, séduit à son tour les foules. Au total, quatre des extraits se classeront ainsi au Top 10.
Alors que la presse le considére surtout comme un phénomène de &quot;teenage sensation&quot;, A-Ha surprend par la densitè de son écriture sur les disques suivants. Aprés une tournée mondiale, il compose la bande sonore du film de James Bond The Living Daylights, dont un remix apparait sur son troisiéme album, Stay On These Roads, et se hisse dans les charts.
Utilisant largement les synthétisurs, ce disque à l'humeur variée et au ton plus adulte donne lieu à deux autres tubes, Touchy ! et You Are The One. Puis, aprés d'autres albums allant dans la mème direction musicale, les membres de A-Ha se consacrent à des activitès de plus en plus diversifièes... et de moins en moins communes.</p>
<p>The full track listing to each album is included at the lower half of the back sleeve in black, with the album titles being in red. The spine displays two silver overlapping Compact discs at the top, with the same text &quot;Coffret 2 CD Originaux&quot; included underneath. The titles &quot;A-HA HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; and &quot;STAY ON THESE ROADS&quot; are printed in white and displayed in the centre, whilst at the bottom of the spine, there is a black and white &quot;WARNER STATEGIC MARKETING FRANCE&quot; logo. On the top section of the slipcase, it again includes the silver Compact disc images and &quot;Coffret 2 CD Originaux&quot; text, plus &quot;A-HA HUNTING HIGH AND LOW / STAY ON THESE ROADS&quot; in black. The bottom section of the slipcase instead includes a &quot;WARNER STATEGIC MARKETING FRANCE&quot; black and white logo, Catalogue number 9362-47937-2 WE 859 and white barcode &quot;0 93624 79372 4&quot;. There is also some french Copyright and Marketing Information shown; &quot;Tous droits du producteur phonographique et du propriètaire de l'oeuvre enregistrèe rèserves. Sauf autorisation, la duplication, la location, le prèt, l'utilisation de ce disque pour exècution publique et radiodiffusion sont interdits! une division de warner music france - a warner music group company © 2000 warner strategic marketing france/warner music france&quot;. The year of this release appears to be around 2000.</p>

<p>On 5 December, Warner Brothers released the &quot;a-ha Trilogy Three Classic Albums&quot; set in the UK. The packaging is like a hard-back book with the title and three small pictures of the covers of the featured albums (Hunting High And Low, Scoundrel Days and Stay On These Roads) on a grey background. There is also a large white 3 across the sleeve which goes behind the pictures. The reverse of the &quot;book&quot; is black, again with pictures of the three albums and track listings below. Pictures of the album covers also feature on the &quot;spine&quot; of the book with the title. Inside, the three CDs are housed on transparent CD trays which open like pages of the book. All CDs are regular copies of the album, German made. The CD inserts can be found in a pocket on the left hand side, there is also a leaflet advertising trilogy series by other artists.</p>

<p>The South African release is quite different from the UK made edition and comes in a thick 3-way jewel case rather than the card sleeve. The cover artwork is similar to the UK release but the three album covers printed on the front are larger. The back sleeve does not include the test &quot;A-HA THREE CLASSIC ALBUMS&quot;. The marketed &amp; distributed by Gallo text is printed on the back sleeve along with the Gallo Logo (in place of the Rhino Logo). It comes with a 6 page booklet with pictures and track listings of the three albums on a black background, but there are no lyrics.</p>
