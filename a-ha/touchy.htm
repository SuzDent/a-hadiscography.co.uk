The UK 7&quot; release features a brownish black and white band-shot (Morten, Mags and P&aring;l) by Just Loomis on a white background. A light blue a-ha logo is printed on a small black rectangle in the upper right corner. The song title is written in small dark blue letters directly below the logo.
The reverse offers a large light blue vertical a-ha-logo on a light grey rectangular background. The logo is partly covered by five small brownish black and white shots featuring the band members. The rest of the cover is white with track listing in small dark blue letters plus a small colour print of the &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;-album.

In addition to the LP-version of &quot;Touchy!&quot; the single also includes the LP-version of &quot;Hurry Home&quot;.
<p>Limited numbers of the 7&quot; singles come with a free poster (same as poster which comes with 12&quot;, see below). A sticker on the front of the 7&quot; tells about the offer &quot;Free poster with this single please ask at the counter W 7749 V Subject to availability&quot;.
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/tou7b.jpg" ALT="Touchy! UK 7&quot; wrong sticker on B-side" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Some pressings of the limited edition 7&quot; singles have the wrong label stuck on the B-side. The label of the German made disc claims that the B-side plays Van Halen's &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot;, but in actual fact, it plays the usual &quot;Hurry Home&quot;. It is thought that this 7&quot; may have originally been produced for the French market as the disc label has text in French in addition to German and English, although the English limited edition sticker on the front suggests that it was used for the English market.</p>
<p>There are two different limited edition 7&quot; tri-fold releases. They are identical except for the a-ha-logo on the front cover. One of the logos
is made by green felt while the other is a green blue `liquid' logo.</p>
 <p><center><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="146" SRC="singles/touchfel.gif" ALT="Touchy! UK Limited Felt Logo 7&quot;"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="146" SRC="singles/touchliq.gif" ALT="Touchy! UK Limited Liquid Logo 7&quot;"></center></p>
<p>Both of the front covers are otherwise plain white with &quot;Limited Edition&quot; written in black letters in the bottom right corner. The sleeve opens out with two black and white pictures inside, one of P&#0229;l
and one of Morten. There is a black and white picture of Mags on the back of where the 7&quot; (same as regular, only German) slots in (all photography by Just Loomis). 
The reverse of the sleeve is plain white with the tracks written in small letters in the centre. The &quot;felt&quot; limited edition of the 7&quot; is rarer than the liquid edition. Supposedly there were a few problems with the liquid-logos with some of them splitting open during transportation.</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="408" HEIGHT="130" SRC="singles/toultd.jpg" ALT="Touchy! UK Limited Liquid Logo 7&quot; (Folded Out)"></p>
<p>There is also a DJ promotional 7&quot; which features a &quot;DJ Edit&quot; version of &quot;Touchy!&quot; (3:34). This release comes in the same sleeve as the regular 7&quot; with an additional &quot;Special DJ Edit&quot;-sticker on the sleeve and disc label. Some copies also come with a promo sheet with details of the single with the release date hand written on.</p>

<p>The front of the 12&quot; is similar to the front of the 7&quot;. The reverse is also similar but there are 8 small brownish black and white pictures instead of 5. The 12&quot; has the additional track which is a &quot;Go-Go Mix&quot; (written on the front of the 12&quot; under the title) of &quot;Touchy!&quot; (8:20) mixed by John Hudson with additional production and remix by Paul Simpson.

Limited numbers of the 12&quot; come with a free poster. The 22&quot;x22&quot; poster is a colour-shot of a-ha by Just Loomis taken at the same photo session as the one on the cover of &quot;You Are The One&quot; except that Morten is pictured in the middle on this occasion and is looking at the camera.</p>
  <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="127" SRC="singles/touchcd.jpg" ALT="Touchy! CD-single" ALIGN="LEFT">
The 3&quot; CD comes in a 5&quot; jewel case with a white plastic adapter. The cover is similar to the front of the 7&quot; single and the reverse of the insert has 3 small brown and white group pictures and large blue &quot;a-ha&quot; logo on a grey background. The German made CD is silver with dark grey titles and WB-logo.
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="151" SRC="singles/touchy_kwilde.jpg" ALT="Touchy! mis-print" ALIGN="RIGHT">
An interesting mis-print of the &quot;Touchy!&quot; CD single has the regular a-ha cover, but the disc plays Kim Wilde's &quot;You Came&quot;. The disc has been printed with the text for both a-ha's &quot;Touchy!&quot; and Kim Wilde's &quot;You Came&quot;!
This time the a-ha logo is in block form with silver writing on a dark grey background. The tracks on the CD are album tracks except for the &quot;Go-Go Mix&quot; of &quot;Touchy!&quot;.</p>
