<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/mems1.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky front cover"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/memsc.jpg" ALT="a-ha picture (page 1 of CD booklet)"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/memse.jpg" ALT="Reverse of CD booklet"></p>
	
<p>The cover of the regular CD release features a picture of an aeroplane's cockpit photographed by Bj&oslash;rn Opsahl in a desert outside Las Vagas. a-ha has been printed on the side of the cockpit in large letters. The album title has been placed over the 'sand' underneath the cockpit.</p>
	
<p>The CD booklet includes the song lyrics (some of which do not match the lyrics sung!) and around eight colour pictures of the band / individual members by Bj&oslash;rn Opsahl. The reverse of the booklet features a picture of an aeroplane wing against a blue sky. The a-ha logo has been placed in the bottom left hand corner and the catalogue number in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
	
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="129" SRC="albums/memsb.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky back sleeve"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/memsdisc.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky disc"></p>

	<p>The background image of the back cover shows part of the metallic body of the aeroplane's cockpit. The tracks are listed in a white font. Some of the words in each song title (or part of the word in the case of &quot;Velvet&quot;) are printed in a larger font. Beneath the tracks are individual shots of Morten, Magne and Paul, plus additional white text. The spine uses a cross section of the sky and sand taken from the cover picture with titles in black.</p>

<p>The top half of the disc is light blue and the bottom half is a beige colour. A black line separates the two colours. The silver a-ha logo is placed in the top half of the sleeve, while the tracks are printed in black at the bottom. Again, the tracks have been printed using variable sized fonts.</p>

<p>The CD tray is transparent, through which you can see the picture of the aeroplane's cockpit. The picture is the same as that on the cover of the album, but the a-ha logo has been omitted from the side of the cockpit and information about the official web site and management replaces the album title over the sand.</p>
	
<p>As well as the regular release, there also exists a German made limited edition release. It is believed that this release might well be a bootleg release due to the fact that the track &quot;Barely Hanging On&quot; is misspelt as &quot;Barley Handing On&quot; on both the back insert and disc. Also, this &quot;limited edition&quot; takes on the same catalogue number (but different barcode??) as the regular edition, rather than having its own unique number. Another factor is that the colours and sharpness of the fonts on the sleeve are inferior to the regular release. In addition the back insert and disc include a &quot;Polo Music&quot; logo which could be a logo of the manufacturers. Official or not, this item is, never-the-less, nicely presented. In addition to the 13 tracks of the regular release, it includes the five bonus tracks: Crying in the Rain (4:23), Early Morning (2:59), Hunting High and Low (remix) (3:48), Take On Me (3:48) and Summer Moved On (Remix) (6:00). Total running time = 79:43.</p>

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="147" SRC="albums/memsltd.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky limited edition" align="right">
	The limited edition comes with a 4-page fold-out front sleeve. The front of this sleeve is almost identical to the regular release, but at the bottom it states that it is a &quot;limited edition&quot; and &quot;this cd also contains 5 bonus tracks&quot;. The reverse of the sleeve is also identical to its regular counterpart. Inside the fold-out sleeve are four pictures taken from the booklet of the regular release but with the lyrics printed over the top. The lyrics are prnted in blocks so as to avoid covering the faces of the band members.</p>

	<p>The back-insert is identical to the regular release, apart from the obvious difference in the track listing with the inclusion of the five &quot;bonus tracks&quot;. The spine has the additional text &quot;limited edition&quot;.</p>
<p>The disc is also similar to the regular release, but with additional text listing the bonus tracks. &quot;limited edition&quot; is also printed at the top of the disc, below the a-ha logo.</p>

<p>As with most albums, there was a promo copy issued. It comes in a blue and white wea sleeve. The top section of the sleeve is white with several small blue wea logos scattered around. The bottom section of the sleeve is light blue with the tracks printed in black and a wea logo faded into the background. Across the sleeve are some white and black boxes with a-ha, the title and &quot;promotional copy not for sale&quot; printed within. The disc is light blue and silver - of similar design to the front sleeve. The track list and other text is printed in black in the bottom section of the disc with a-ha and the title printed inside respectively silver and black boxes at the top. The tracks are recorded in the same order as on the regular release. The CD comes in a slimline jewel case.</p>

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="145" SRC="albums/memspr2.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky promo CD" ALIGN="RIGHT">
At least two different promo CD-R's of the album were available. One comes with a white sleeve which has <NOBR>A-HA</NOBR> and the title printed in large letters at the top of the sleeve and the track listing underneath.</p>
	
<p>The tracks are in a different order to those on the regular release and there are small differences in two of the song titles (&quot;Company Man&quot; and &quot;I Thought That It Was You&quot; rather than &quot;The Company Man&quot; and &quot;Thought That It Was You&quot;) - see below. The disc is silver with black titles and wea logo</p>
	
<p><B>Tracks:</B> Minor Earth, Major Sky / Little Black Heart / Velvet / You'll Never Get Over Me / The Sun Never Shone That Day / Summer Moved On / To Let You Win / I Wish I Cared / Barely Hanging On / Company Man / I Won't Forget Her / I Thought That It Was You / Mary Ellen Makes The Moment Count</p>

<p>The other, German made, promo also has a silver disc with black text. &quot;a-ha&quot; and the title are printed at the top of the disc. The WEA-logo and standard compact-disc logo are respectively on the left and right sides of the disc. The following text is printed at the bottom of the disc: &quot;WEA Records Germany FOR PROMOTION USE ONLY!&quot;.</p>
<p>The CD comes with a frontsleeve and a back insert. The front-side of the front-sleeve is a black and white copy of the disc itself, on a black background. The reverse of the front-sleeve has the grey outline of a CD as background image. Over the top of this CD, the tracks are printed with a-ha plus title above. The WEA and the compact-disc logos are placed in, respectively, the bottom left and bottom right corners.</p>

&nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="115" SRC="albums/memscdr3.gif" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky promo reverse sleeve"></p>
		
<p>The back-insert is almost identical to the back-side of the front-sleeve, except that the grey CD-image is missing and the additional text &quot;WEA Records Germany FOR PROMOTION USE ONLY!&quot; has been printed at the bottom.</p>
		
<p>The tracks have been recorded in the same order as they are on the promo disc listed above. The track are listed in a similar way to the promo above, except for &quot;I Thought That It Was You&quot; which is printed as &quot;Thought That It Was You&quot;, as on the regular album release. The given track lengths also differ slightly from the regular release.</p>
		
<p>There is promo &quot;press pack&quot; of the album which comes in a blue carboard boxed sleeve (approx. size when closed: 29cm x 13cm) with &quot;a-ha&quot; printed on the front in embossed silver letters. On the reverse, track information is printed in white text.</p>
		
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="184" SRC="albums/memspr.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth Major Sky promo pack cover (opened out)"> &nbsp; 
<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="189" SRC="albums/memspr3.jpg" ALT="The discs and inside of the packaging"</p>
	
<p>The sleeve opens out to reveal individual shots of the band memebers (Morten, Magne and Paul) which have been placed in a row above a blue and white &quot;sky&quot; image. &quot;new album&quot; and &quot;a-ha&quot; are printed respectively above and below the picture of Magne, whilst &quot;minor earth&quot; is printed between Morten and Magne and &quot;major sky&quot; between Magne and Paul, all of which are in white letters. Two white &quot;moon shape&quot; cut-outs can be found at either end of the row of pictures. They don't seem to have any function, since the box seals with the help of velcro. The promo pack hasn't been given a catalogue number. Inside the box there are two discs which sit side by side in black trays, one is a promo copy of the album, the other is a CD-Rom featuring a bio, photo's, discography, interview and video message. Both discs are silver with black text.</p>
	
<p>The new a-ha logo, in white letters, is printed on one of the inside flaps of the packaging. There are two moon shape cut-outs either end of the logo, again they seem to have no function. The inside of the other flap has the following four paragraphs of text printed on it in white letters. The text on the left hand side is in German whilst that on the right is in English:</p>
	
<p>&quot;On March (note: the German text suggests 27th March as the date, but the English side just says March!), a-ha will release the single <NOBR>&#0187;Summer</NOBR> Moved On&#0171;, to be followed by the album &#0187;Minor Earth Major Sky&#0171; on April (note: again the German side gives the exact date of 17th April). This is the first new music from the Norwegian trio since 1993 and marks the beginning of a new chapter in the <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> saga.</p>
		
<p>After having enjoyed massive international success in the 1980's, the three members of a-ha - Morten Harket, P&aring;l Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen - spent much of the following decade working on individual projects, ranging from Furuholmen's acclaimed paintings to Waaktaar's band with his wife Lauren Savoy. &#0187;We needed to establish ourselves on our own terms&#0171;, the band says of the time spent apart from each other.</p>
		
<p>Having done just that, the three now bring a whole range of new elements and qualities to &#0187;Minor Earth Major Sky&#0171;. While their melodies and arrangements are as lush and majestic as ever, the band's growth and evolution is evident in ways both subtle and obvious throughout the album's x songs.</p>
		
<p>&#0171;Having had the sort of success we've had, we don't really have anything to prove in the commercial sense,&#0171; feels Morten Harket. ..Rather, this is about us finally proving what we're capable of as artists and musicians. &#0187;And the astonishing thing is that, in every way you could think of, we're simply better than ever...&#0171; &quot;</p>
	
<p>The cassette edition of the album has similar sleeve design to the regular CD release.</p>
		
<p><CENTER><IMG WIDTH="245" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/mecassfr.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Cassette Sleeve (front)"></CENTER></p>
	
<p>The reverse of the insert features a faded picture of a-ha (Morten, Paul and Magne) sitting inside an open top car. Information about the tracks and production are printed over the top in white letters, but the song lyrics have not been included. The actual cassette is transparent / grey with white titles.</p>

The silver a-ha logo is displayed as usual on the top half with the full track listing in varied fonts shown in black at the bottom. The black &quot;wea&quot; logo is included on the left hand side with some Production text; &quot;℗ 2000 WEA RECORDS Warner Music Germany GmbH. Made in RSA by CDT.

<H4>Taiwan</H4>
<p>The album was also released in Taiwan. The regular CD release comes with a white and green obi strip which features black and green text.
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="134" SRC="albums/metaifr.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Taiwan front sleeve (with obi strip)"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="131" SRC="albums/metaibk.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Taiwan back sleeve (with obi strip)"></p>
<p>Limited editions of the album come in a unique card slip case with lyric sheet and poster calendar! The front cover of the slip case is unique, the top half features the picture found on the cover of the regular release, where as the bottom section features a picture of the band sitting inside a car (similar to the one found inside the cassette edition of the European album). Across the middle of the cover, the a-ha logo is printed in light blue and the title is written in white in Taiwanese text! Additional Taiwanese text is printed in orange above.</p>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/metailt1.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Taiwan Limited Edition (front sleeve)"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/metailt2.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Taiwan Limited Edition (back sleeve)"></CENTER>
<p>The reverse of the slip case features a close-up shot of the grey metallic body of the aeroplane nose. Small pictures of <NOBR>a-ha's</NOBR> previous releases (excluding Memorial Beach) are printed across the bottom. Track details and other information is printed over the rest of the sleeve, again in Taiwanese. The spine of the case shows the album title printed in both English and Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Inside the slip case are the regular &quot;Taiwan made&quot; album in jewel case (without obi strip), a lyric sheet with lyrics printed in Taiwanese, an advertising sheet showing new releases (including &quot;Minor Earth, Major Sky&quot;) and a fold out poster calendar. There are a few minor differences between the German made and Taiwan made CDs. There are obvious text differences relating to country of manufacture, more of the actual disc of the Taiwan release has been printed on (i.e. printing is closer to the centre of the disc), the Taiwan CD booklet uses heavier / thicker paper and the catalogue number has not been printed in the bottom right hand corner of the reverse of the booklet.</p>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/calendar.jpg" ALT="Limited Edition Calendar (Taiwan)"> &nbsp;
	<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="168" SRC="albums/metailt3.jpg" ALT="Minor Earth | Major Sky Taiwan Limited Edition"></CENTER>
<p>The poster calendar opens out making it six times the size of a regular CD-booklet. The picture on the poster is the one of a-ha sitting inside a car, as on the front of the slip case. In the bottom right hand corner, there is a calendar for 2000, including only the months June - December. In the bottom left hand corner is a large white a-ha logo and the title in black underneath.</p>
<p>This limited edition album may have been re-released, for there exists a similarly packaged album which has an additional sticker of red text stuck over the seal, just above the title on the slip case. Translated, this text reads &quot;No.1 chart at 18 country, 8 items of MTV music awards, 30000000 albums sell&quot;</p>
