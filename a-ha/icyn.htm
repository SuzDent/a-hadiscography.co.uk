<TR><TD>The UK 7&quot;-release features a large blue block a-ha-logo and a smaller red logo on a dark blue background. A small multicolour band-shot by Just Loomis is placed in the upper right corner, while &quot;I Call Your Name / A-HA&quot; has been written repeatedly in dark blue on a red and light blue background across the top of the picture sleeve.</td>

</TABLE>
The reverse features a similar set-up, the red a-ha-logo exempted. The small band-shot is different, but taken from the same photo session. Track listings plus the lyrics to &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; have been written in light grey and white letters. Finally a small advert for the &quot;East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon&quot;-album has been included in the lower right section of the sleeve. Both the single &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; plus the flip &quot;The Way We Talk&quot; are album-versions.

The second 7&quot; &quot;Limited Edition Hits E.P. / Number Two&quot; is released in the UK only. The front of the picture sleeve is white with a light blue block a-ha-logo and a smaller dark red logo. It has a fold out sleeve, with a black and white band picture on the inside flap  The picture on the front of the normal 7&quot; is placed on a dark blue background with a large blue a-ha-logo and the lyrics in white on the other side.
The reverse of the sleeve is similar to the reverse of the normal 7&quot;, but with no album picture. The strip at the top is just dark red, no lyrics and a longer track listing.</p>

The sleeve of the promotional 7&quot; is identical except for the occasional &quot;Special DJ Edit&quot;-sticker or stickers including phone numbers of WB-employees or WEA information sheet. The a-side features an edited version of the single (4:06) which seems the same as the album version except that it fades earlier, while the b-side of the promo contains the album version of the single. The track listing on the sleeve then does obviously not agree with the tracks actually on the record.</p>

<tr><td>There is again a cassette single released in England which has a slightly different cover layout. The background is the large blue a-ha-logo which is written round the whole insert and the titles on the spine are in white. The front of the sleeve has the red a-ha-logo printed at the top and the picture from the 7&quot; is printed underneath. &quot;Cassette Single&quot; is also written in red capital letters along the bottom The insert folds out with the tracks written in white and a small &quot;East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon&quot;-album picture.</td>
