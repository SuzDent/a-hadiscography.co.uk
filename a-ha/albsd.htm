        The original CD release of Scoundrel Days was &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot;.

The back sleeve is in white with the full track listing printed again in grey down the left and centre parts of the upper sleeve. The barcode is displayed in the top right hand corner with the catalogue number 925 501-2 shown underneath. Some Production credits to Alan Tarney, Mags and Pal Waaktaar are also shown. The lower section of the back sleeve displays a landscape scene with an additional picture of the three band members located on the left hand side and includes the &quot;WB Records&quot; logo. On the lower right hand side, there is some Compact Digital Disc recording information which reads; &quot;The music on this Compact Digital Disc was originally recorded on analog equipment. We have attempted to preserve, as closely as possible, the sound of the original recording. Because of its high resolution, however, the Compact Disc can reveal limitations of source tape&quot;. There is also some &quot;Warner Bros Records Inc.&quot; Production and Copyright information; &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc., a Warner Communications Company © 1986 Warner Bros.

A Warner Communications Company&quot; and comes with the same long fold-out lyric insert. The layout of the disc is similar to the earlier pressing but comes instead with the standard clear plastic centre ring and doesn’t include the &quot;Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; text printed around the bottom edge of the disc.
