        The original CD release of Scoundrel Days was &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot;. The front cover is more close up than that of the LP release and comes without the ink blotch. The layout of the title &quot;a-ha Scoundrel Days&quot; is handwritten along the top in grey. The back sleeve is in white with the full track listing printed again in grey down the left and centre parts of the upper sleeve. The barcode is displayed in the top right hand corner with the catalogue number 925 501-2 shown underneath. Some Production credits to Alan Tarney, Mags and Pal Waaktaar are also shown. The lower section of the back sleeve displays a landscape scene with an additional picture of the three band members located on the left hand side and includes the &quot;WB Records&quot; logo. On the lower right hand side, there is some Compact Digital Disc recording information which reads; &quot;The music on this Compact Digital Disc was originally recorded on analog equipment. We have attempted to preserve, as closely as possible, the sound of the original recording. Because of its high resolution, however, the Compact Disc can reveal limitations of source tape&quot;. There is also some &quot;Warner Bros Records Inc.&quot; Production and Copyright information; &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc., a Warner Communications Company © 1986 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S. & WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S. ℗ 1986 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S. &amp; WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S. All Rights Reserved. Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws&quot;. Along the very bottom is some manufacturing text; &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf – Presse en Allemagne par Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf. A Warner Communications Company&quot;. The disc itself is silver with black text and comes with a double centre ring, it displays the A-HA logo at the top with the title &quot;SCOUNDREL DAYS&quot; printed underneath. The track listing is shown down the left hand side with the &quot;COMPACT disc DIGITAL AUDIO&quot;, &quot;GEMA/BIEM&quot; logos and LC0392 on the right hand side. The same &quot;Warner Bros.

        <P>The second German release was instead &quot;Made by Nimbus&quot; and comes with the same front and back cover sleeves as the original CD pressing. The back sleeve also displays that it was; &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf – Presse en Allemagne par Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf. A Warner Communications Company&quot; and comes with the same long fold-out lyric insert. The layout of the disc is similar to the earlier pressing but comes instead with the standard clear plastic centre ring and doesn’t include the &quot;Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; text printed around the bottom edge of the disc. On the right hand side, underneath the usual &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; Production and Copyright text, it additionally includes the wording &quot;Made by Nimbus&quot;. The catalogue number 925 501-2 and matrix coding 925501-2 @ 1 around the centre ring of the disc is exactly the same.</P>
        <P>There is another &quot;Nimbus&quot; manufactured CD edition of Scoundrel Days which was pressed in England and comes with the same regular German &quot;Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; front and back cover sleeve. The layout of the disc is also very similar to the original German made release which again comes with a double centre ring, but it now includes the additional text; &quot;Made in England by NIMBUS&quot; shown on the right hand side underneath the &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; Production and Copyright Information. Unlike the German &quot;Nimbus&quot; edition, the UK made edition additionally includes the text; &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot; around the bottom edge of the disc.
