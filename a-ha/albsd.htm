        <P>The cover of this album is white with a blue and green landscape picture plus inset a-ha picture. It was released on LP, cassette and CD. The LP has an embossed `ink blotch' printed on the front above the picture. The back of the LP is white with a continuation of the landscape picture along the bottom, a small colour outdoor picture of a-ha (as on the cover of the single &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot;) and the tracks written in blue and green. The inner sleeve has a colour picture of part of Mags and PÂl and some of the song words. On the other side are the rest of the song words and two small colour pictures of a-ha.</P>
        <table border="0">
            <tr><td>The front cover of the CD is more close up than that of the LP and without the ink blotch.
