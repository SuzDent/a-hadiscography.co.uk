The 7&quot;-release features a colour shot of the band (Morten, Mags &amp; P&#0229;l) by John Paul with a large purple and white a-ha-logo on a blue background down the left side and title in blue at the top.
The reverse is white with a purple and white a-ha logo on a blue background printed vertically along the left hand side. In addition there are four coloured shots including one promoting the album &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; on a white background, while the track listing is printed in a light purple colour. The 7&quot; features the album versions of &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot; plus &quot;There's Never A Forever Thing&quot;.
<p>There is also a box-sleeved &quot;Special Limited Edition&quot; available in the 7&quot;-format. Professing to include colour postcards this release falls short of the expectations and as far as we know only offer black and white postcards. The front of this limited edition is identical to the regular release except the misguiding information printed in white capital letters right above the song-title. The reverse of this spined sleeve is plain white with track listing in small light purple letters and an envelope opening. This box-sleeved edition contains the regular picture sleeve and record.</p>
