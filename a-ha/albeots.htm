	The second pressing comes with the a-ha logo printed instead in plain purple capital letters, the remainder of the text is also in purple apart from the words &quot;EAST/SUN&quot; and track numbers again being in black. The matrix number around the centre ring of the disc is the same as the first pressing 759926314-2 RSA, but the Catalogue number on the back sleeve has now changed to 7599-26314-2 WE 835, omitting the word France.

All of the other text is also in black apart from the &quot;EAST/SUN&quot; wording on the title and track numbers which are coloured purple instead of previous black. The disc also comes with the same matrix coding 759926314-2.4 01/99 as the third pressing, which includes the January 99 re-issue date.

<p>The Yugoslavian LP press of &quot;East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon&quot; was by record company &quot;Jugoton&quot;; it is similar to the UK/European edition displaying the same front and back cover artworks. On the reverse of the sleeve, the barcode at the bottom left-hand corner is slightly larger and displays a different number &quot;8 600412 029051&quot; compared to the UK/European release. The Yugoslavian Catalogue number LP-7-1 2 02905 1 printed above the barcode is different and does not include the UK: WX 378 reference. The European number 7599-26314-1 Ⓤ is however included underneath. At the bottom left hand-side, the regular &quot;WB&quot; logo and &quot;LC0392&quot; coding is included along with a &quot;Jugoton&quot; symbol. Some Croatian production and English manufacturing information is displayed; &quot;Produzece za nakladu audio, video I informatickih zapisa, p.o. Zagreb, Niska bb. Made in Yugoslavia&quot; when translated it reads; &quot;Produced for the production of audio, video and computer records, p. Zagreb, Niska bb. Made in Yugoslavia&quot;. There is also some reference to the Croatian Editorial chief; &quot;Urednik redakcije: Veljko Despot Glavni i odgovorni urednik: Sinisa Skarica&quot; which again translates to; &quot;Editor of the editorial board: Veljko Despot Editor-in-chief: Sinisa Skarica&quot;. Along the bottom of the back sleeve is the usual Warner Bros. Records Company contact address and copyright information, which appears on the UK/European edition but omits the wording &quot;Made in Germany&quot; at the end. The inside of the sleeve comes with the same lyric inner sleeve as the UK/European edition, but the catalogue number on-display has been changed to LP-7-1 2 02905 1. The record labels are white with black printed text, coming again with a very similar layout to the UK/European edition. The regular colour &quot;WB Records&quot; logo is displayed at the top, with the title &quot;a-ha EAST OF THE SUN, WEST OF THE MOON&quot; and production text; &quot;PRODUCED BY CHRIS NEIL *PRODUCED BY IAN STANLEY&quot; underneath. On the left-hand side, the &quot;STEREO&quot; and &quot;SOKOJ/BIEM&quot; symbols are included, with &quot;SIDE ONE&quot; or &quot;SIDE TWO&quot; instead displayed on the right-hand side. At the lower half of the label, the full track listing is included along with production credits and track lengths. Some additional publishing information; &quot;All tracks published by (G.B. only)/ Warner Chappell Music Ltd. except 1.Screen Gems-EMI Music Ltd&quot; is shown, along with the regular record company production text; &quot; ℗ 1990 Warner Bros. Records. Inc. for the U.S. & WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S.&quot;. Both the European 7599-26314-1 and Yugoslavian LP-1-1 2 02905 1 Catalogue numbers, along with &quot;A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY&quot; is also included at the bottom of each label. Around the outer edge of the labels on both sides, is some Croatian manufacturing and copyright information which reads; &quot;SVA PRAVA IZDAVACA I VLASNIKA SNIMLJENOG DJELA SU PRIDRZANA, ZABRANJENO JE NEOVLASTENO UMNOZAVANJE, POSUDIVANJE, IZNAJMLJIVANJE, JAVNO IZVODENJE I EMITIRANJE OVE PLOCE - PO LICENCI PROIZVEO • JUGOTON - ZAGREB.

At the bottom of the spine it includes the &quot;Jugoton&quot; logo along with the Catalogue number MC-7-S 3 02905 0. The inside of the insert folds out to include the usual full track lyrics, but there is some additional Croatian text shown on the inside of the back cover; &quot;Urednik redakcije: Veljko Despot Glavni I odgovorni urednik: Sinisa Skarica&quot;, it translates to &quot;The editor of the editorial board: Veljko Despot Editor in Chief: Sinisa Skarica&quot;.
