The cover of this Japanese only mini album has a group studio picture with a yellow and pink title logo on a blue background. The CD insert folds out with the lyrics, and individual pictures of the 3 band members (Magne being on the back of the insert). The CD comes with a white obi strip with red, blue and black text. 
<p>The CD features a group shot as found on the UK 12&quot; picture disc of &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body&quot;.</p>

<p>There are 2 slightly different obi-strips for this mini Japanese album. The differences are very subtle - one has three lines of text at the top of the obi, whilst the other has two. The one with 3 lines of text has 2 different prices printed at the bottom of the spine, the other has just one price. Otherwise these releases seem to be exactly the same with same catalogue numbers.
