<P>The second European single (first single in the UK) from the album &quot;Lifelines&quot; was the title track. It was released in the UK and Germany on 8th July 2002 and in Norway on 15th July. Two CDs were released in Germany.</P>

The cover of the single features a green-tone close up shot of the archways found on the front cover of the album, but taken from underneath. Below the arches are some steps with two stools on the top step. The a-ha logo in yellow is in the top right hand corner of the sleeve with the title in white underneath. The reverse of the sleeve features a different shot of the arches with the a-ha logo in yellow at the top and track information underneath. The spine is green with white text. The disc is white with a green and white emblem of a flower with the title printed in white.
<P>The UK release comes in a regular CD-single jewel-case. It features the &quot;Radio Edit&quot; of Lifelines (3:59), live versions of Hunting High And Low (7:07) and Manhattan Skyline (6:14) (as found on the European release of Forever Not Yours) plus the enhanced video of Lifelines. The disc is white with a green and white emblem of a flower, similar to that found on the album disc. The catalogue number printed on the disc is WEA351 CDX, but it is printed as WEA353 CDX on the spine! On the spine the title is printed incorrectly as &quot;Lifelines - Remixes&quot; (even though the disc does not include any remixes) and the video length is listed as 0:01! There wasn't a cassette single release on this occasion.</P>

<P>There were two different singles released in Germany. The first has a similar cover and disc to the UK release, but comes in an album style case with an insert which opens out. The disc features four different mixes of &quot;Lifelines&quot;. The inside of the insert features a green tone picture of the band sitting in theatre seats with Magne looking through a camera. The a-ha logo is printed in yellow at the top with track information in white underneath. A printed yellow 'sticker' on the front of the sleeve advertises the fact that the single &quot;feat. 4 remixes of Lifelines&quot;.
