            <H2>Hunting High And Low (28.10.85)</H2>
            <HR>
<p>a-ha's debut album &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; was released world wide. It was produced by Tony Mansfield, except tracks 1 and 6 by Alan Tarney and track 8 by John Ratcliff with <nobr>a-ha</nobr>. It was remixed by John Ratcliff with <nobr>a-ha</nobr> except &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; and &quot;Living A Boy's Adventure Tale&quot; remixed by John Ratcliff. All tracks were written by P&aring;l Waaktaar except track 1 by P&aring;l, Mags and Morten, track 5 by P&aring;l and Morten and tracks 8 and 9 by Mags and P&aring;l.</p>
<p>The cover of the German made 10-track CD has a black and white photo of the band taken in a cafe (by Just Loomis) with a grey a-ha-logo and red title in the top left corner. 
<p style="text-align:center;"><IMG WIDTH="503" HEIGHT="250" SRC="albums/hhl_UKCD.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK CD cover"></p>
<p>The reverse of the insert is white with 3 small black and white individual pictures of the band members, pencil smudge marks plus black text to the left about &quot;caring for your CD&quot;. The catalogue number is printed in black in the top left hand corner.
The white insert opens up with track listing on the left hand side and production, mastering and other information printed in black on the right hand side.
<p style="text-align:center;"><IMG WIDTH="503" HEIGHT="252" SRC="albums/hhl_UKCD2.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK CD back of cover"></p>
<p>The back insert of the CD is white with black titles and a black and white picture of a-ha in front of a mirror (as on &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; single). The CD itself was &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf&quot; and is silver with black titles.</p>

&nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhal_gold2.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low Gold CD" align="right"></nobr>
There also exist gold disc editions of the CD album which has similar packaging, but the disc itself is gold with black text. The gold CD editions may have a gold sticker on the front which reads &quot;40 GOLDEN GREATS! WEA&quot;, or a gold, red and white sticker with the text &quot;Limited Edition. Bild am Sonntag. Gold! WEA&quot;.</p>
<p>The cover of the German made 10-track LP has the same cover design as the CD. The reverse of the LP is white with 3 small black and white individual pictures of the band members, similar to the back of the CD insert, but with the CD care information replaced with other text in grey. One side of the inner sleeve is white with a black and white large picture of a-ha in front of a mirror (as on the back sleeve of the CD), the other side is black with the negative version of the same picture.</p>
<p>The LP release was &quot;Manufactured by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf in Germany&quot;, it is very similar to the European LP release which was also &quot;Manufactured by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf&quot;, but doesn't include the UK catalogue number &quoit;WX 30&quot;. In the top right hand corner of the back cover, it displays the standard &quot;7599-25300-1&quot; barcode number with the Germany &quot;925 300-1 (U)&quot; and France &quot;WE 381&quot; LP catalogue numbers underneath. 
Additionally displayed is the catalogue number for the German cassette release &quot;925 300-4&quot;. Along the bottom of the back cover, underneath the &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; handwriting, is some English and French manufacturing information which reads &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf. Presse en Allemagne par Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf a Warner Communications Company&quot;. 
<p>On the label itself it displays the usual colour &quot;Warner Brothers Records&quot; logo at the top with &quot;a-ha HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; underneath. The full track listing along with some production and publishing information &quot;All songs by Pal Waaktaar except as indicated. Produced by Tony Mansfield. Remixed by John Ratcliff with a-ha. Published by: G.B. only) 1-5 ATV Music Ltd. (P) + (C) 1985 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S. &amp; WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S.&quot; is also shown. Displayed on the left hand side are the &quot;STEREO&quot; and &quot;GEMA/BIEM&quot; logos with the catalogue number &quot;925 300-1&quot; at the bottom. Around the outer edge of the label is some manufacturing and copyright information which has been printed in all three languages English, French and German, the same as the European issue. 
Also included is the regular inner sleeve which displays the picture of the band members sitting in front of a mirror. The German only Catalogue number &quot;925 300-1&quot; is additionally shown at the top right hand corner.</p>
<p>A German made special edition of the album was produced for &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; (the organisation by German Media-Corporation &quot;Bertelsmann&quot;). The LP is similar to the regular release, but the unique catalogue number and &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is printed in the top right hand corner of the reverse of the sleeve. &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is also printed on the label. It is thought that this LP might have been pressed for the UK market as the UK catalogue is also printed on the reverse of the sleeve, so too is a circled &quot;U&quot;.</p>
<p>Re-issues of the LP have &quot;reprise&quot; on the spine in place of the usual &quot;warner bros&quot;.</p>
<p>The picture on the front of the cassette is the same as the LP / CD but is printed in a square on a white background with &quot;a-ha&quot; written in grey above and &quot;hunting high and low&quot; written in red underneath. The spine of the insert is white with red text. The actual cassette is white with black text.</p>

The LP release has &quot;caza mayor y menor&quot; as the title &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; on the front cover. Note that the correct Spanish translation of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; should be &quot;Cazando por arriba y por abajo&quot; or &quot;Cazando por todas partes&quot; (thanks to Roberto Delgado) or &quot;Buscandote por todos lados&quot; (thanks to Jose Arambula). The title printed on the sleeve is a literal translation which doesn't make proper sense. The WEA logo is printed in the upper right hand corner and the cover print is darker black and white. The reverse of the sleeve and labels also have the text in Spanish e.g. &quot;Take On Me&quot; is written as &quot;tomalo por mi&quot;. The promo edition is the regular LP with a &quot;Promocional, phohibida su venta&quot; stamp.  The CD edition is similar to the European release but has an &quot;ifpi&quot; hologram sticker on the front of the case and the text in the bottom left hand corner of the back sleeve is in Portuguese. The back sleeve and disc indicate that the album was published by Warner Music Argentina.

The inside of the insert is white with blue text, listing the tracks in Argentinian and English. The cassette was made by &quot;EMSA&quot; and is cream with brown text. The catalogue number on this first pressing is 4-25300.
</p><p>The second pressing is very similar to the earlier pressing including having the same front cover artworks, but comes with a different catalogue number 90934, the &quot;DOLBY SYSTEM&quot; text has been printed much clearer on this copy. The inside of the insert is again white with blue text, it now includes some additional manufacturing information printed in Spanish on the inside of the back cover which reads &quot;Fabricado y distribuido por EMI ODEON S.A.I.C. San Martin 3590 - Florida&quot;. The actual tape is now coloured white with brown text, it displays the same additional &quot;EMI&quot; manufacturing information on the bottom left hand corner which didn't appear on the first pressing.
</p><p>There was another Argentine cassette pressing which was again released by &quot;EMI&quot;, but comes again with a different catalogue number 93934. The front cover artworks is the same, but the inside of the insert is now printed with black text instead of the usual blue which was used on the earlier pressings. The information is however exactly the same including the additional &quot;EMI&quot; manufacturing information. The tape is again coloured white, although there appears to be two slightly different issues of it, some copies come with blue printed text, whilst others have brown printed text. The information and layout is however exactly the same on both.</p>

<H4>Yugoslavia</H4><p> 
The Yugoslavia LP of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; has a similar cover to the European release but the text on the back cover has been printed much bolder, at the top next to the barcode, we have a large &quot;Suzy&quot; logo, whilst at the bottom right hand corner above the &quot;Warner Bros.&quot; logo, we have some publishing information which is printed in Bosnian and reads &quot;Izdavač: Izdavačka radna organizacija SUZJ Zagreb, Gruška 10, Jugoslavija Mušicki urednik: Ranko Antonić Direktor - glavni i odgovorni u rednik: Hrvoje Markulj&quot;. The usual German Manufacturing information at the bottom left hand corner has been partly covered up in white, leaving only the section &quot;A Warner Communications Company&quot; on show. There also appears to be two different pressings, although both come with the exact same front and back cover sleeve, the 1st pressing comes with picture labels featuring an artist drawing of a tree - lined street with the tracks listed in black over the bottom of the picture. At the top, we have &quot;BURBANK, HOME OF WARNER BROS. RECORDS&quot; in large lettering, the title &quot;A-HA HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; is displayed underneath in a much smaller font. Around the outer edge of the label is some Manufacuring and Copyright information;- &quot;ALL RIGHTS OF THE MANUFACTURER AND OF THE OWNER OF THE RECORDED WORK RESERVED. UNAUTHORIZED PUBLIC PERFORMANCE BROADCASTING AND COPYING OF THIS RECORD PROHIBITED. PRESSED BY JUGOTON&quot;. It also has displayed at the bottom &quot;SUZY RECORDS PRODUCTION&quot;.
</p><p>The second pressing comes with the more usual white lined label with black text, it displays the &quot;Warner Bros&quot;. logo at the top with the title underneath, the track listing including the credits and production information is shown on the lower half of the label. Around the outer edge is the exact same Copyright information which appeared on the first pressing, although the &quot;Pressed by Jugoton&quot; has now been omitted and replaced instead by &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc./WEA Internaional Inc&quot;. The first pressing appears not to come with the usual inner sleeve but the second pressing additionally included one. The catalogue number on both pressings is however exactly the same 925300-1.</P>

<p>The cassette has a slightly different sleeve compared to the UK release.

<H4>Zimbabwe</H4><p>The Zimbabwe LP release is very similar to the South African pressing which again comes with the same duller front and back cover compared to the German release, the round circle displaying the printed text &quot;Includes the hit singles TAKE ON ME and THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES ON T.V.&quot; is also shown on the right hand side of the front cover. On the back cover the same Catalogue number WBC 1594 as the South African release is displayed in the top right hand corner, it also additionally shows that it was &quot;Available on Cassette: ZWB 1594&quot;. Along the bottom of the back cover, the usual &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; handwriting is on display but has been partly printed over with some black Marketing and Copyright information which reads &quot;Marketed by WEA (Pty) Ltd. A Warner Communications Company a division of Warner Communications Inc. All Rights Reserved - Unauthorised Duplication is a Violation of Applicable Laws&quot;. The actual Label on the Record is white and unlike the South African pressing, all of the text including the &quot;Warner Bros. Records&quot; logo is printed in black rather than some parts being in colour, the actual layout and design also differs, around the top outer edge of the label, we have some Copyright information, plus that the record was &quot;Manufactured by TEAL Record Company&quot;.
