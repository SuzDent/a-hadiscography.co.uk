<p style="text-align:center;">
<IMG WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhl_eucas1.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK cassette cover - first and second pressings"></p>
<p>The first pressings of the cassette include black tapes with grey printed text and come in two slightly different variations. One edition displays the title &quot;a-ha / HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; along the top, all on one line, with the track listing underneath. On the left of each side, it includes a small &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo, the &quot;BIEM/GEMA&quot; symbol, and the German 925 300-4 and UK WX 30C catalogue numbers. The side reference &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; and &quot;DOLBY 120μs HX-pro B-NR&quot; symbol is included at the bottom right-hand corner of either side. Along the bottom of side 1, we have some copyright information which reads &quot;All rights of the producer and of the owner of the work reproduced reserved!. Unauthorised copying, hiring, public performance and broadcasting of this recording prohibited&quot;. Whilst along the bottom of side 2, it instead includes some production and record company information; &quot;Produced by Tony Mansfield. Remixed by John Ratcliff with a-ha. ℗ + © 1985 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S. & WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S.&quot;.
The second variation of the black tape comes with a different layout to the title included along the top. The a-ha logo is now printed on its own, with the title &quot;HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; printed directly underneath, but in a smaller font size compared to the earlier first release. The track listing is also included under the title but printed in uppercase lettering rather than the previous lowercasing. The remainder of the cassette is otherwise the same apart from the &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo on the left-hand side is slightly larger. The release also comes with the same German 925300-4 and UK WX 30C catalogue numbers, copyright information printed along the bottom of side 1, production and record company text along the bottom of side 2, and &quot;GEMA/BIEM&quot; and &quot;DOLBY 120μs HX-pro B-NR&quot; symbols located on either side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<IMG WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhl_eucas2.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK cassettes - first and second pressings"></p>
<p>The second pressing comes with the exact same insert as the first pressing which was also &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf&quot;. Some copies again come with the extended back cover to cover up the whole tape. The actual tape is black with a silver stickered label and black printed text. The layout and design is slightly different compared to the earlier pressed tapes, the font size is some what smaller on some of the text including the title a-ha / Hunting High And Low at the top which is now printed in lower case lettering, the &quot;WB Records&quot; logo on the left hand side is also larger compared to the earlier pressings, plus the Dolby logo on the bottom right hand corner of each side now shows &quot;DOLBY SYSTEM®&quot;. The same two catalogue numbers are used on this second pressing &quot;925 300-4&quot; for Germany and &quot;WX 30C&quot; for the UK.</p>
<p>There is third cassette edition which has an almost identical sleeve to the first pressing, but doesn't have the &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf&quot; text printed down the inside spine of the insert. It also has oval holes punched into the sleeve, rather than the circular ones of the first release. The cassette is light grey with black titles and again contains a slightly different layout compared to the previous editions. The title &quot;a-ha / Hunting High And Low&quot; is displayed as usual along the top, with the track listing to each side now split up into three seperate lines underneath the title. The regular &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo and German 925 300-4 and UK WX 30 C Catalogue numbers are included on the left-hand side, although positioned slightly nearer to the title and track listing. On the right-hand side, the side &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; reference are displayed, but much smaller compared to the earlier editions. The usual &quot;BIEM/GEMA&quot; symbol is included at the bottom left-hand corner, with the &quot;DOLBY SYSTEM®&quot; at the bottom right. The regular copyright information is printed along with bottom of side 1, with the usual production text; &quot;Produced by Tony Mansfield. Remixed by John Ratcliff with a-ha ℗ + © 1985 Warner Bros.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<IMG WIDTH="525" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhl_ukcas.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK cassette"></p>
<p>There is another pressing of the cassette which again displays that it was &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf&quot; but appears to have been marketed by &quot;Warner Music Europe&quot;, it comes with a slightly amended spine on the insert, the &quot;WB Records&quot; logo is printed across the spine with the 3 catalogue numbers in smaller font underneath, rather than along the spine as per the previous releases. The French catalogue number reads &quot;FRANCE WE 421&quot; (instead of &quot;FRANCE WE 481&quot;) and the German one has a circled G after the number, rather than a U. The actual cassette is transparent with a grey centre and white text, the catalogue number on the left hand side has changed to read &quot;7599-25300-4&quot;, plus the layout and design, including the font size of the text has also been changed. The production information on side 2 has also been amended to read &quot;Produced by Tony Mansfield Side 1: *Remixed by John Ratcliff **PRODUCED BY ALAN TARNEY Side 2: *PRODUCED BY ALAN TARNEY **PRODUCED BY JOHN RATCLIFF WITH a-ha ℗ + © 1985 Warner Bros.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<IMG WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/hhl_eucas3.jpg" ALT="Hunting High And Low UK cassette - fourth pressing"></p>
<p>A slight variation of the above pressing is one with a round yellow sticker displaying a white ! symbol on the front plus &quot;Warner Music&quot; and &quot;Warner Music Group&quot; logos inscribed into the plastic on the back cover and side of the box.
The cassette itself is similar except for the catalogue number displayed reads &quot;925 300-4&quot; compared to earlier edition which includes &quot;7599-25300-4&quot;.</p>
<p>One further edition of the "Hunting High And Low" cassette comes with just a single sided paper insert based on the earlier releases, but without including any of usual track production credits, photographic credits, a-ha Fan Club address or &quot;WB Records&quot; logo and contact address details on the inside of the insert. The tape is coloured beige with a white vinyl stickered label and black printed text. The layout is identical to the silver stickered second pressing, but it is not confirmed as to whether this is an official release or not?.

The Argentine LP release has &quot;caza mayor y menor&quot; listed as the title &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; on the front cover; it is coloured in a darker red. Note that the correct Spanish translation of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; should be &quot;Cazando por arriba y por abajo&quot; or &quot;Cazando por todas partes&quot; (thanks to Roberto Delgado) or &quot;Buscandote por todos lados&quot; (thanks to Jose Arambula). The title printed on the sleeve is a literal translation, which does not make any proper sense. There is a &quot;WEA&quot; logo included in the upper right-hand corner and the remainder of the regular album cover print is of a darker black and white. On the reverse of the sleeve, the full track listing down the left-hand side and other regular production and photographic credits is all listed in Spanish e.g. &quot;Take On Me&quot; is written as &quot;tomalo por mi&quot;.

The record itself comes with white labels and black printed Spanish text. The regular colour &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo is included at the top with the title &quot;CAZA MAYOR Y MENOR&quot; and &quot;a-ha (Interprete)&quot; printed underneath. Some other production text; &quot;Prod. por Tony Mansfield-(*) Prod. por Alan Tarney&quot; and &quot;(**) Prod. por John Ratcliff con a-ha&quot; (on side B only) is also shown. Above the &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo, there is some manufacturing and distributing information; &quot;PUBLICADO POR wea discos s.r.l. FABRICADO Y DISTRIBUIDO POR EMI-ODEON SAIC San Martin 3590 – Florida (Pcia. de Bs. As.)&quot;. On the left-hand side, the Argentine Catalogue number 80934 A or B is shown including the side reference, whilst on the right-hand side, it instead displays the standard US Catalogue number 25 300-A or B and again includes the side reference within. Below the centre hole, the full track listing is shown with all the tracks again listed in both Spanish and English, the track lengths and some track credits are also included alongside. At the bottom of label on each side is some additional record company production text; &quot;℗ 1985 Warner Bros Rec. Inc. para los EE.UU & WEA Int. para el resto del mundo&quot;.

<p>The promo edition is the regular LP with a "Promocional, phohibida su venta" stamp.</p>
<p>The Argentine CD edition is similar to the European release, displaying the title &quot;a-ha hunting high and low&quot; in English rather than Spanish which appears on the Argentine LP & Cassette release of the album. The front of the CD case also comes with an &quot;ifpi&quot; hologram sticker, most of the text at the bottom left hand corner of the back sleeve and around the outer edge of the actual disc is printed in Spanish; &quot;warner bros records inc., a warner communications company ℗ 1985 warner bros. records inc. para los estados unidos y wea international inc. para el resto del mundo.

San Martin 3590 - Florida&quot;. The actual tape is now coloured white with brown text, it displays the same additional &quot;EMI&quot; manufacturing information on the bottom left hand corner which didn't appear on the first pressing.</p>
	    <p>There was another Argentine cassette pressing which was again released by &quot;EMI&quot;, but comes again with a different catalogue number 93934.

Additionally displayed is the catalogue number for the German cassette release &quot;925 300-4&quot;. Along the bottom of the back cover, underneath the &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; handwriting, is some English and French manufacturing information which reads &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf. Presse en Allemagne par Record Service GmbH, Alsdorf a Warner Communications Company&quot;.
On the label itself it displays the usual colour &quot;Warner Brothers Records&quot; logo at the top with &quot;a-ha HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; underneath.

Around the outer edge of the label is some manufacturing and copyright information which has been printed in all three languages English, French and German, it's exactly the same as the European issue. Also included is the regular inner sleeve which displays the picture of the band members sitting in front of a mirror. The German only catalogue number &quot;925 300-1&quot; is additionally shown in the top right hand corner.</p>

<p>A German made special edition of the LP was produced for &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; (the organisation by German Media-Corporation &quot;Bertelsmann&quot;). The LP is similar to the regular release, but the unique catalogue number and &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is printed in the top right hand corner of the reverse of the sleeve. &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; is also printed on the label. It is thought that this LP might have been pressed for the UK market as the UK catalogue is also printed on the reverse of the sleeve, so too is a circled &quot;U&quot;.</p>
There is also a &quot;Club-Sonderauflage&quot; German cassette edition which is similar to the European edition and was also &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf&quot;. The release comes with the regular front cover artworks but the layout on the spine and back sleeve is slightly different. The spine comes with a unique catalogue number 33 390-6 and has &quot;CLUB SONDERAUFLAGE&quot; printed in the usual red at the bottom. The &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; is also present but has been displayed orientated rather than landscaped. The back sleeve is similar to some of the European editions which include the extended back cover covering up the whole of the tape, but there is no barcode been added and shows only the track listing for each side printed down the centre. The usual track production information to &quot;Tony Mansfield&quot;, &quot;Alan Tarney&quot; and &quot;John Ratcliff&quot; is also included. On the inside of the insert, the regular layout is displayed containing the track production credits, photographic credits to &quot;Just Loomis&quot; and the &quot;a-ha Fan Club address at The Post Office, High Street, Headley, Bordon, Hants, GU35 8BQ England&quot;. The &quot;WB Records&quot; logo and contact address is also shown; &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc. - 3300 Warner Blvd, Burbank, Calif 91510&quot;. The regular &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service GmbH Alsdorf - Presse en Allemagne par Record Service GmbH Alsdorf a Warner Communications Company&quot; information is again shown on the reverse of the spine. The tape itself is black with a silver stickered label and black printed text. The layout and design is virtually the same as the European second pressing displaying the regular title; &quot;a-ha / Hunting High And Low&quot; along the top with the track listing to each side underneath. The usual &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; logo is displayed on the left hand side along with the revised catalogue number 33 390-6 and &quot;BIEM/GEMA&quot;. On the right hand side, the additional wording &quot;CLUB-SONDERAUSGABE&quot; is shown, along with a large side &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; and the &quot;DOLBY SYSTEM ®&quot; logo. Along the bottom of side 1 is the same Copyright information which appears on the European edition, whilst along the bottom of side 2, it includes the production text; &quot;Produced by Tony Mansfield. Remixed by John Ratcliff with a-ha ℗ + © 1985 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the U.S. & WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the U.S.&quot;.

On the inside of the insert on the reverse of spine, the usual &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Record Service Aldorf&quot; information has also been removed.

<H4>Yugoslavia</H4><p> 
The Yugoslavia LP of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; has a similar cover to the European release but the text on the back cover has been printed much bolder, at the top next to the barcode, we have a large &quot;Suzy&quot; logo, whilst at the bottom right hand corner above the &quot;Warner Bros.&quot; logo, we have some publishing information which is printed in Bosnian and reads &quot;Izdavač: Izdavačka radna organizacija SUZJ Zagreb, Gruška 10, Jugoslavija Mušicki urednik: Ranko Antonić Direktor - glavni i odgovorni u rednik: Hrvoje Markulj&quot;. The usual German Manufacturing information at the bottom left hand corner has been partly covered up in white, leaving only the section &quot;A Warner Communications Company&quot; on show. There also appears to be two different pressings, although both come with the exact same front and back cover sleeve, the 1st pressing comes with picture labels featuring an artist drawing of a tree - lined street with the tracks listed in black over the bottom of the picture. At the top, we have &quot;BURBANK, HOME OF WARNER BROS. RECORDS&quot; in large lettering, the title &quot;A-HA HUNTING HIGH AND LOW&quot; is displayed underneath in a much smaller font. Around the outer edge of the label is some Manufacuring and Copyright information;- &quot;ALL RIGHTS OF THE MANUFACTURER AND OF THE OWNER OF THE RECORDED WORK RESERVED.

Records Inc./WEA Internaional Inc&quot;. The first pressing appears not to come with the usual inner sleeve but the second pressing additionally included one. The catalogue number on both pressings is however exactly the same 925300-1.</P>

<H4>Zimbabwe</H4><p>The Zimbabwe LP release is very similar to the South African pressing which again comes with the same duller front and back cover compared to the German release, the round circle displaying the printed text &quot;Includes the hit singles TAKE ON ME and THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES ON T.V.&quot; is also shown on the right hand side of the front cover. On the back cover the same Catalogue number WBC 1594 as the South African release is displayed in the top right hand corner, it also additionally shows that it was &quot;Available on Cassette: ZWB 1594&quot;. Along the bottom of the back cover, the usual &quot;Warner Bros.
