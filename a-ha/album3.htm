The CD insert folds out. Inside the insert there is a black and white group photo of the band standing in a field. On the reverse there are three individual colour pictures.

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/bib6.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil - Disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The CD is silver coloured with black titles and &quot;a-ha&quot; logo. The songs on the album are all studio versions taken from the albums.</p>
<p>There are at least four different CD pressings of this album, all of which have the same catalogue number.
<p>The first &quot;Microservice&quot; pressing comes without a barcode on the back and the catalogue number is 30582-2 (without the 'M' at the start). The manufacturing information on the bottom of the disc and back of the sleeve differs slightly from the second and third &quot;Microservice&quot; pressings. The text on the disc is &quot;Fabricado pela MICROSERVICE - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas Ltda, CGC 43 359 926/0001-80 - Sao Paulo&quot; and on the back sleeve the text is blue and reads &quot;FABRICADO PELA MICROSERVICE - MICROFILMAGENS E REPRODUCOES TECNICAS LTDA C.G.C. 43.359.926/0001-80 - SAO PAULO - IND.

<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="170" SRC="albums/bib_text.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of first, second and third pressings"></p>
<p>The second pressing also has missing barcode but has a 'M' at the start of the catalogue number. The manufacturing text around the bottom of the disc is &quot;Fabricado pela MICROSERVICE - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas Ltda, CGC 34.525.444/0001.62&quot; and the text on the back cover is on a white background and reads &quot;Produzido pela Microservice - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas da Amazonia Ltda, na Zona Franca de Manaus - CGC: 34.525.444/0001-62 Ind. Brasileira, Sob encomenda de BMG Ariola Discos Ltda - Av. Eng. Billings. 2227 - Sao Paulo - CGC: 56.697.162/0002-66 - SCDP-DPF 050/87 SP - Musica e Cultura&quot;.
<p>The third &quot;Microservice&quot; pressing also has a 'M' at the front of the catalogue number (this has been printed in a smaller font and on a white background on the spine of the cover) and also has a barcode on the back. The Record Company Text which is again also shown on a white background reads &quot;

<p>There are also at least four &quot;Videolar&quot; pressings. They all  have a barcode on the back sleeve. Two have the manufacturing information printed in blue without a white background, another is blue on a white background and the third is black text on a white background. Two of them (one of the blue text on yellow background and blue text on white background) have the following manufacturing text: &quot;http://www.warnermusicbrazil.com.br  Warner Music Brasil Ltda.

<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="318" SRC="albums/bib_text2.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of four Videolar pressings"></p>
<p>
The discs are all similar to the &quot;Microservice&quot; pressings but the Record Company information is displayed around the top of the disc &quot;FABRICADO POR VIDEOLAR R - INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA - SOB LICENCA DE WARNER MUSIC BRASIL LTDA. DISTRIBUIDO PELA BMG ARIOLA DISCOS LTDA. CGC. 56 697 162/0002-66 SCDPDF 50/87 SAO PAULO - IND. BRASILEIRA.&quot;. There is no publishing information on the bottom left side of the disc, nor the catalogue number and the compact disc logo is printed in black rather than outlined. Each has a different issue code printed in black round the centre of the disc. The blue text on white background issue has code AL0001000, the catalogue number on the spine of this edition has a small M on the front which is on a white background.  The black text on white background issue has code AF0001000 on the disc and this is also printed on one of the spines. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="74" SRC="albums/bib_text3.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of Sonopress pressing"></p>
<p>Finally, there is a Sonopress release which is similar to the Microservice and Videolar releases, but is printed in a slightly lighter colour.

This Argentinian only release has the same front cover as &quot;Best In Brazil&quot; except for the obvious different title in the top left hand corner. The reverse of the LP sleeve has the tracks written only in Spanish, although they are printed in both Spanish and English on the record itself. The cassette has a similar sleeve to the LP with the tracks printed in Spanish. The inside of the cassette sleeve is white with the tracks printed in black in Spanish and English.

The disc sticker features a black and white WB-logo (rather than the coloured logos which are on the regular album) and has a promo stamp.</p>

<P>The first Argentine CD release of Headlines and Deadlines comes with a navy disc with beige text, it is similar to the European release. The booklet is also the same as the EU release. There is a silver &quot;FLAPF&quot; hologram sticker on the front of the CD case. On the back cover the layout and design is again very similar to the European release but it additionally displays the &quot;WARNER MUSIC ARGENTINA&quot; logo at the top underneath the barcode. At the bottom left hand corner of the back cover and on the actual disc itself, we have some different Manufacturing and Copyright information which is printed in Spanish, it reads &quot;(P) & (C) 1991 WEA International Inc.

The Catalogue number on the front cover, spine and tape is 4-26773. The &quot;Warner Brothers Records&quot; and &quot;Warner Music Argentina&quot; logos are also displayed on the front cover.

On the inside of the folded insert on side 2 above the artworks for the &quot;Move to Memphis&quot; single, the exact same Spanish Copyright and &quot;DOLBY-NR&quot; information is shown but has been displayed differently compared to the first pressing. Also on side 2 again underneath the track listing and credits, it displays &quot;WARNER MUSIC ARGENTINA&quot; but the logo is smaller, it also shows some different text &quot;A WARNER MUSIC GROUP COMPANY&quot; and &quot;DISCO ES CULTURA&quot; which didn't appear on the first pressing.

<P>In 1996, the album was rereleased in the same case, but slipped inside a unique white carton sleeve sponsored by NRJ radio. On the spine and cover of the sleeve it calls the album &quot;Best Of a-ha&quot;. On the front of the sleeve there is a group shot (PÂl, Morten and Mags) in the centre. There is something a little bit stange about this photo as Morten has bright green eyes rather than his normal blue ones!

The usual CD booklet is also included. The disc is again navy with beige text but now includes an outer silver ring to it which doesn't appear on the first issue. The Matrix coding around the centre ring is also slightly different to read 7599267773-2.2 WME.</p>
<p>There is a third issue of the European CD album which uses the same 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852 Catalogue number on the back cover, again the front and back cover is identical to the earlier issues and the same CD booklet is also included. The design of the disc used is the same as the first issue and doesn't include the outer silver rim on the edge of the disc which appeared on the second issue, but the Matrix coding has again been changed to now read 759926773-2.3 WME.</p>
<P>In June 99, there was a another European CD album re-issue of &quot;Headlines And Deadlines&quot; which was again &quot;Manufactured in Germany by Warner Music Manufacturing Europe&quot;, it comes with the same usual front and back cover artworks to the early 7599-26773-2 FRANCE 852 pressings, but now includes a different Catalogue number 7599-26773-2 WE 835 on the back cover, the FRANCE part of the Catalogue number has now been omitted. Additionally displayed on the front cover of the CD case is a round yellow sticker with a white ! sign. The same usual CD booklet is also included. The disc is again navy and includes an outer silver rim to the disc, but the text has now been printed in cream (rather than beige), making it much more clearer. Also the track listing displayed on the right hand side is somewhat smaller compared to the earlier 7599-26773-2 FRANCE 852 pressings. The &quot;Warner Music Europe&quot; Logo has also been inscribed onto the silver centre ring of the disc and the Matrix coding has now been changed to 759926773-2.3 06/99.</P>

I'm led to believe that this pressing was not used for the general release in the UK as it seems rather scarce. This 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 833 edition is very similar to the earlier 7599-26773-2 FRANCE WE 852 first release which includes the same disc which is navy with beige text and comes without the outer silver rim on the edge of the disc. it also includes the same matrix coding reference 759926773-2 WME.
