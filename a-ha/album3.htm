<HR>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="154" SRC="albums/bib.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil" ALIGN="RIGHT">
This Brazilian only release has a colour photo cover. The band shot (P&aring;l, Morten, Mags) is placed on the right hand side of the sleeve, filling approximately 3/4 of the cover. The remainding quarter is yellow. The title in blue with pink trim is placed in the top left corner.</p>
<p>The reverse of the LP is lemon coloured with blue / grey writing and a picture of a-ha in a field. There is also an inner sleeve with three individual large pictures. The reverse of the inner sleeve is yellow with blue / grey a-ha-logo and four pictures of the previous albums.
<p style="text-align:center"><IMG WIDTH="299" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/bib4.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil CD insert"></p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="116" SRC="albums/bib5.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil - CD back insert" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The CD insert folds out. Inside the insert there is a black and white group photo of the band standing in a field. On the reverse there are three individual colour pictures. The back insert has the colour version of the picture found inside the CD insert on a lemon coloured background. There is also a blue and pink edged &quot;a-ha&quot; logo plus blue titles. 
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/bib6.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil - Disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The CD is silver coloured with black titles and &quot;a-ha&quot; logo. The songs on the album are all studio versions taken from the albums.</p>
<p>There are at least four different CD pressings of this album, all of which have the same catalogue number.
<p>The first &quot;Microservice&quot; pressing comes without a barcode on the back and the catalogue number is 30582-2 (without the 'M' at the start). The manufacturing information on the bottom of the disc and back of the sleeve differs slightly from the second and third &quot;Microservice&quot; pressings. The text on the disc is &quot;Fabricado pela MICROSERVICE - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas Ltda, CGC 43 359 926/0001-80 - Sao Paulo&quot; and on the back sleeve the text is blue and reads &quot;FABRICADO PELA MICROSERVICE - MICROFILMAGENS E REPRODUCOES TECNICAS LTDA C.G.C. 43.359.926/0001-80 - SAO PAULO - IND. BRASILEIRA - DISTRIBUIDO PELA BMG ARIOLA DISCOS LTDA. C.G.C. 56.697.162/0002-66 SCDPDPF 50/87 SAO PAULO - IND. BRASILEIRA - SOB LICENCA DA WARNER MUSIC BRASIL LTDA.&quot;.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="170" SRC="albums/bib_text.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of first, second and third pressings"></p>
<p>The second pressing also has missing barcode but has a 'M' at the start of the catalogue number. The manufacturing text around the bottom of the disc is &quot;Fabricado pela MICROSERVICE - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas Ltda, CGC 34.525.444/0001.62&quot; and the text on the back cover is on a white background and reads &quot;Produzido pela Microservice - Microfilmagens e Reproducoes Tecnicas da Amazonia Ltda, na Zona Franca de Manaus - CGC: 34.525.444/0001-62 Ind. Brasileira, Sob encomenda de BMG Ariola Discos Ltda - Av. Eng. Billings. 2227 - Sao Paulo - CGC: 56.697.162/0002-66 - SCDP-DPF 050/87 SP - Musica e Cultura&quot;.
<p>The third &quot;Microservice&quot; pressing also has a 'M' at the front of the catalogue number (this has been printed in a smaller font and on a white background on the spine of the cover) and also has a barcode on the back. The Record Company Text which is again also shown on a white background reads &quot;
WARNER MUSIC BRASIL LTDA. - C.G.C. 42.470.112/0001-56 PRODUZIDO PELA MICROSERVICE - MICROFILMAGENS E REPRODUCOES TECNICAS DA AMAZONIA LTDA., NA ZONA FRANCA DE MANAUS - C.G.C. 34.525.444/0001-62 DISTRIBUIDO PELA BMG ARIOLA DISCOS LTDA. C.G.C. 56.697.162/0002-66 SCDPDPF 50/87 - INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA&quot;. The disc of the second pressing is the same as the second pressing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="132" SRC="albums/bib2.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil with safety hologram"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="132" SRC="albums/bib3.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil Videolar pressing"></p>
<p>There are also at least four &quot;Videolar&quot; pressings. They all  have a barcode on the back sleeve. Two have the manufacturing information printed in blue without a white background, another is blue on a white background and the third is black text on a white background. Two of them (one of the blue text on yellow background and blue text on white background) have the following manufacturing text: &quot;http://www.warnermusicbrazil.com.br  Warner Music Brasil Ltda. Fabricado na Zona Franca de Manaus por VideoLar Multimidia Ltda. - Av. Solimoes, 505 Distrito Industrial CGC 22.797.096/0001 -01 Industria Brasileira Distribuido, pela Warner Music Brasil Ltda. CGC42.470.112/0012-09&quot;. They also have a large compact disc logo to the left of the text. The black text on white has the following text: &quot;Warner Music Brasil Ltda., uma empresa Warner Music Group. Produzido no Polo Industrial de Manaus por Videolar S.A. Av. Solimoes, 505 - Distrito Industrial - Manaus - AM - CNPJ 04.229.761/0004-13 - Industria Brasileira - Distribuido pela warner Music Brasil Ltda. CNPJ 42.470.112/0012-09 www.warnermusic.com.br.&quot; There is also the flying Amazon bird logo above the text box and large compact disc logo to the left.
The other blue text on yellow background has the text &quot;Warner Music Brasil Ltda., uma empresa Warner Music Group. Produzido no Polo Industrial de Manaus por Videolar S.A. Av.

</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="318" SRC="albums/bib_text2.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of four Videolar pressings"></p>
<p>
The discs are all similar to the &quot;Microservice&quot; pressings but the Record Company information is displayed around the top of the disc &quot;FABRICADO POR VIDEOLAR R - INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA - SOB LICENCA DE WARNER MUSIC BRASIL LTDA. DISTRIBUIDO PELA BMG ARIOLA DISCOS LTDA. CGC. 56 697 162/0002-66 SCDPDF 50/87 SAO PAULO - IND. BRASILEIRA.&quot;. There is no publishing information on the bottom left side of the disc, nor the catalogue number and the compact disc logo is printed in black rather than outlined. Each has a different issue code printed in black round the centre of the disc. The blue text on white background issue has code AL0001000, the catalogue number on the spine of this edition has a small M on the front which is on a white background.  The black text on white background issue has code AF0001000 on the disc and this is also printed on one of the spines. </p>
<p>Promo copies of the album have a gold circular &quot;Amostra BMG invendav&eacute;l&quot; unsaleable stamp on the back sleeve. The blue text on yellow with Amazon bird issue has code AJ0000500 on both the disc and on one of the spines.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><p><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="74" SRC="albums/bib_text3.jpg" ALT="Best In Brazil text on reverse of Sonopress pressing"></p>
<p>Finally, there is a Sonopress release which is similar to the Microservice and Videolar releases, but is printed in a slightly lighter colour. The Brazilian manufacturing information is printed in blue text on a yellow background as follows: &quot;Warner Music Brasil Ltda., uma empresa Warner Music Group.

<H3>Variations</H3>
<P><B>Argentina:</B> The first Argentine CD release of Headlines and Deadlines comes with a navy disc with beige text, it is similar to the European release. The booklet is also the same as the EU release. There is a silver &quot;FLAPF&quot; hologram sticker on the front of the CD case. On the back cover the layout and design is again very similar to the European release but it additionally displays the &quot;WARNER MUSIC ARGENTINA&quot; logo at the top underneath the barcode. At the bottom left hand corner of the back cover and on the actual disc itself, we have some different Manufacturing and Copyright information which is printed in Spanish, it reads &quot;(P) & (C) 1991 WEA International Inc.

<P>The second Argentine CD release of &quot;Headlines and Deadlines&quot; comes instead with a black disc with grey text rather than the usual blue one with beige text. The front and back cover is exactly the same as the first pressing. The same booklet is also included. There is a &quot;ifpi&quot; silver hologram sticker on the front of the CD case.</P>
</P>The Argentine cassette release of &quot;Headlines and Deadlines&quot; comes with &quot;LO MEJOR&quot; printed in white at the beginning of the title on the front cover, the remainder of the text inside of the folded insert is displayed all in Spanish. The track listing on the back sleeve has been printed in yellow instead of the usual beige. The first pressing was made by &quot;EMSSA&quot; and comes without a white barcode on the back sleeve. The Catalogue number on the front cover, spine and tape is 4-26773. The &quot;Warner Brothers Records&quot; and &quot;Warner Music Argentina&quot; logos are also displayed on the front cover. There is some Spanish Copyright and &quot;DOLBY-NR&quot; information on the inside of the folded insert on side 2 above the artworks for the &quot;Move to Memphis&quot; single, it reads &quot;Prohibida la reproduccion, locacion y prestamo de este ejemplar y su radiodifusion o ejecucion publica.

De no contar con esta posibilidad, ajustar convenientemente el control de agudos&quot;. Also on side 2 underneath the track listing and credits, it displays the &quot;WARNER MUSIC ARGENTINA&quot; logo and &quot;Una compania del grupo Time Warner&quot;. The tape itself is transparent clear with a grey centre piece and white printed text. The title &quot;LO MEJOR DE A-HA&quot; is shown at the top with the Spanish track listing to each side underneath. The &quot;Warner Brothers Records&quot; and &quot;Warner Music Argentina&quot; logos are also displayed along with the text &quot;INDUSTRIA ARGENTINA&quot; and &quot;SADAIC-BIEM AADI-CAPIF&quot;. The same Copyright information which appears on the inside of the folded insert is also displayed at the bottom of both sides.
</P>The second pressing comes without the Catalogue number and &quot;Warner Brothers Records/Warner Music Argentina&quot; logos on the front cover, it was also made by &quot;EMSSA&quot; and includes a white barcode on the back sleeve. On the spine the Catalogue number has been changed and now shows the full European Catalogue number 7599-26773-4, the &quot;Warner Music Argentina&quot; logo has also been printed much smaller compared to the first pressing and the &quot;DOLBY-NR&quot; logo has been omitted. On the inside of the folded insert on side 2 above the artworks for the &quot;Move to Memphis&quot; single, the exact same Spanish Copyright and &quot;DOLBY-NR&quot; information is shown but has been displayed differently compared to the first pressing. Also on side 2 again underneath the track listing and credits, it displays &quot;WARNER MUSIC ARGENTINA&quot; but the logo is smaller, it also shows some different text &quot;A WARNER MUSIC GROUP COMPANY&quot; and &quot;DISCO ES CULTURA&quot; which didn't appear on the first pressing. The tape is white with brown printed text, the layout and design is exactly the same as the earlier transparent clear tape including using the same original Catalogue number 4-26773.</P>
