The obi includes coloured text, blue stars with &quot;The very best&quot; in yellow plus the track listing. The disc itself is dark green with white text. It comes with the usual insert booklet, but all of the text is in white rather than a combination of white and colours, as is the title on the front sleeve.</p>

<p>This release also comes with a large double-sided white folded paper sheet which has the lyrics in English, some other Taiwanese text about the band, plus three black and white shots of a-ha. Although the catalogue number is the same as the EU release, the back cover indicates that the CD was made in Taiwan by UFO Group under licence from WEA International inc.</p>
