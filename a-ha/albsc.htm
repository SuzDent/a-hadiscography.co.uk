                <tr><td>The first pressing of the CD edition has an almost identical sleeve to the second pressing. The obi strip of the first pressing is a paper one this time, but is white with a purple a-ha-logo and black text rather than the blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; obi of the second pressing. The CD insert is a 4 page booklet with lyrics, but no pictures. It is available on 12&quot;, 12&quot; picture disc, CD and cassette. The reverse of the CD  insert has a colour band photo on a white background with purple &quot;a-ha&quot; and blue &quot;Scoundrel Club&quot; logo. The CD is the same as the &quot;Twelve Inch Club&quot; CD, again with red &quot;Reprise Records&quot; logo.</td>

            <P>The &quot;Scoundrel Club&quot; 12&quot; picture disc is similar to the picture disc for &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; but with a different title. The sleeve features a picture of the disc on the cover. It comes with an obi-strip. There are two different obi-strips (to be confirmed?), both are light purple with blue text, but the text differs.</P>
