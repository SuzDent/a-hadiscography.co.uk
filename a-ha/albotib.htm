The CD edition is quite rare. It has a similar cover to the LP with the reverse of the front insert is similar to the fold-out card which comes with the LP. The back insert is light blue with a mirror image of the large a-ha logo used on the front sleeve on the left hand side. The track list is printed in black down the centre and there is even a gap between &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot; and &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; indicating that it uses the same artwork as the LP. The disc is plain with black text. The a-ha logo and title are at the top, with the track list on the right hand side and record company information on the left hand side.</p>
<p>There are a very limited number of test pressings which have the same catalogue number. They come with picture sleeve and fold-out poster. The disc label is almost plain white disc label with a small amount of text.</p>
