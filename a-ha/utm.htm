<p>a-ha make a comeback with a new single &quot;Under The Makeup&quot;, released as a download only single in Norway on 3 July 2015.
The cover artwork features a large rock with small pieces breaking off the underside against a gold/brown background. a-ha is printed in grey letters at the top with the title in white underneath.
A second cover artwork was released by Universal Germany following the identification that the previous one was too similar to the cover Italian singer Victorâ€™s 2014 single &quot;I'm a Renegade&quot;. The new cover features a grey-toned shot of some large rocks on a beach (another stock image) with the titles in white above.
