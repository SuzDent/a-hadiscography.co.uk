<p>The Argentine edition comes with the same front cover as the UK/European made release displaying the shot of the band (Paul, Magne, Morten) dressed in black jackets and hats against a grey sky. The title &quot;TIME and AGAIN&quot; is printed in gold with &quot;the ULTIMATE&quot; being instead in white but without the golden background to it and the large a-ha logo again shown in gold at the bottom of the sleeve. The black rectangular sticker; &quot;CD COLLECTION OF A-HA'S BIGGEST HITS + RARE and PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED remixes 8122-79472-0&quot; similar to the one used on the UK edition is also included, but doesn't have rounded corners to it, plus the colouring of the blue text is somewhat darker. The reverse of the sleeve is vertually the same as the UK release, displaying the full track listing again in gold down the left and right hand sides of the upper sleeve. The regular white barcode containing the same number &quot;0 81227 94720 0&quot; as the UK edition is shown as usual in the bottom left hand corner. The same &quot;WB&quot; and &quot;RHINO&quot; logos are also displayed, but an additional &quot;WARNER MUSIC GROUP&quot; one has now been included. Along the bottom of the back sleeve printed in aqua is some additional Manufacturing and Copyright information shown in Spanish which reads; &quot;This Compilation (P) & (C) 2016 Rhino Entertainment Company, a Warner Music Group Company.

SADAIC - BIEM / AADI - CAPIF. INDUSTRIA ARGENTINA&quot;. The discs themselves comes with the regular UK layout which are aqua for disc one with light brown and white text for the title and the large brown a-ha logo spread across the centre, whilst disc 2 comes instead the other way around with a light brown disc with the title shown instead in aqua and white, with the large a-ha logo printed additionally in aqua. Around the outer edge of both discs is the same Spanish Manufacturing and Copyright text which appears on the back sleeve. The release also includes the same colour booklet displaying pictures selected from A-ha's previous albums and history of the tracks included on this complilation taken from quotes by Pal and Magne. The catalogue number 8122-79472-0 also comes with a slightly different layout compared to the UK release.</p>
