<tr><td>The UK release has a white cartoon-style drawing of the band on a black background (illustration by Michael Patterson / Candace Reckinger). The a-ha-logo plus the single title is printed in silver in the upper left corner. In addition, the picture sleeve offers a red speckled part of a rectangle in the lower section plus the (seemingly) haphazard drawing of a thick yellow crayon line across the sleeve.</td>

The reverse has a white background, more of the red speckles, one thick yellow crayon line (continued from the front), a large circled silver a-ha-logo plus &quot;a-ha Train Of Thought&quot; printed in black block letters in the centre of the sleeve. The single contains a remix (4:17) of the album version by Alan Tarney and John Hudson, in addition to the &quot;original version&quot; of &quot;And You Tell Me&quot; (1:56) produced by a-ha.
<p>As with many of the 7&quot; singles, there are versions available with different coloured labels including white, silver, gold and blue metallic.</p>
<p><TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td>As for &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot;-single another shaped picture disc was released (10,000 copies pressed) featuring the same tracks as the regular edition. The a-side of the disc shows a blue futuristic train, while the flip features a black and white group-shot (Morten, Mags &amp; P&#0229;l). The a-ha-logo and track listings are printed in a light blue colour.</td>

The regular UK 12&quot; release has the same picture sleeve as the 7&quot; except of course the additional information concerning the tracks. Once again Steve Thompson is in charge of the a-side U.S.-remix (7:03) while the b-side offers the tracks of the 7&quot;-single. The 12&quot; also comes with a limited edition poster (20&quot;x30&quot;) featuring a black and white group-shot (identical to the b-side of the picture disc) with a pink a-ha-logo placed in the lower left corner. Most of these limited editions have &quot;Includes Free Personality Poster W 8736 TW&quot;-stickers. </p>

and Japanese are printed in red, white and black, while a white a-ha-logo is placed in the lower right corner.
<p>The reverse contains lyrics to &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; (in English and Japanese), a drawn portrait of the group plus additional Japanese information on the album including a minuscule picture. Some copies were distributed containing a fold-out questionnaire with a picture and advertisements for &quot;45 R.P.M. Club&quot; and &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot;-albums. The b-side listed as &quot;And You Tell Me (Demo Version)&quot; is identical to the &quot;Original Version&quot;. The record has a &quot;Reprise Records&quot; colour patterned label, the a-side is a grey paper label with a light grey square and white and grey pattern, the b-side is of a similar design but has a red square and white pattern.
<p><B>New Zealand:</B> The sleeve of the 12&quot; is similar to the U.S. release, but with the usual additional text regarding its marketing in New Zealand on the reverse. On the front, printed above the title, is the text &quot;SPECIALLY PRICED MAXI SINGLE&quot;. The featured &quot;Extended Mix&quot; is the one found on the UK 12&quot;, mixed by Steve Thompson. The 12&quot; has unique orange coloured &quot;Reprise Records&quot; labels featuring a black &quot;steamboat&quot;, similar to the Australian edition.</p>

<p><B>South Africa:</B> The A-side features the regular version rather than the remix and the B-side of the 7&quot; single is &quot;Driftwood&quot;, the same B-side as the previous single &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot;.
<p><B>Spain:</B> The picture sleeve of the 12&quot; has grey text and a-ha-logo instead of silver and the rest of the colours are sharper.

<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/totusa12.jpg" ALT="Train Of Thought USA Promo 12&quot;" ALIGN="RIGHT">
  The 12&quot; promo comes in a unique custom sleeve. The front has a small black and white band-shot in the middle on an off-white background (picture is similar to the ones used for the later releases of &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot;).
A huge light grey a-ha-logo is placed across the upper half of the sleeve, while &quot;train of thought&quot; has been written in smaller black letters just above the middle of the sleeve along with additional information below the picture. The reverse is just plain off-white with no information whatsoever. This release features the album version of the song (4:11) on both sides of the disc and plays at 33 1/3 R.P.M.

This rare 12&quot; is possibly a test pressing of the 12&quot; single. There are 2 (heavy) one sided discs which come in a white sleeve. &quot;k disc mastering&quot; plus an address and contact number in Sunset Boulevard Hollywood, California is printed in grey in the top left hand corner plus &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;client&quot; printed in the top right.
