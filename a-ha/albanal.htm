The title track Analogue (All I Want) is released on January 23rd They may well be best known for their decade-defining hits of the 80s but twenty years on the trio’s influence on some of today’s biggest acts is there for all to hear and see… &quot;the first band I ever loved was a-ha&quot; Coldplay &quot;a-ha was always a rather misunderstood band. They were looked upon as a group for teenage girls, but in reality they were a very creative band&quot; U2 &quot;Take On Me is possibly the best pure pop single of all time&quot; Keane &quot;a-ha…they’re fucking great&quot; Robbie Williams a-ha’s career stats are impressive, over 30 million records sold, 13 top ten singles in the UK and 409 concerts before uncounted millions in 31 countries. The band have just completed an sold out UK arena tour which took in Birmingham, Glasgow, Nottingham, London, Cardiff & Brighton (playing to 65,000 people). The confident and unmistakable tracks such as Analogue, and future single Celice (due to feature in next year’s blockbuster movie ‘The Da Vinci Code’), show that a-ha very much have a strong future as well as a past.

<p><IMG WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/analogue_rusobi.jpg" ALT="Analogue Russian obi-strip" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The Russian release is similar (front, back and disc) to the regular European release, but there is additional Russian text on the back sleeve and also on the disc. The main difference is the front insert, the Russian edition has a double sided insert, rather than booklet, which doesn't contain the song lyrics. The inside of the insert is white with red, silver, white and black flowers plus a large red &quot;finger print&quot;. The track list is on the left hand side in silver and black letters and there is text in Russian on the right hand side. The CD comes with a white obi-strip which has the title in red letters plus the red and silver &quot;Analogue heart&quot;. At the bottom of the obi, there are logos for &quot;Europa Plus&quot; and &quot;MY3TB&quot;. The text on the obi translates as &quot;After three-year silence, the legendary Norwegian group releases new album precisely after 20 years from that time, when their Take On Me hit became leader in Billboard's Top10&quot;. The back of the insert has adverts for Texas, The Cardigans and The Future Sound Of.</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="151" SRC="albums/anal_rus.jpg" ALT="Analogue Russian? lyric page" ALIGN="RIGHT">Another, possibly Russian, edition of the album is almost identical to the regular European release, but has 3 bonus tracks which are 3 mixes of &quot;Celice&quot;: Radio Cut, Live at Frognerparken and Paul Van Dyk's Radio Edit. It doesn't come with an obi-strip and appears not to include the a-ha desktop player. There is no text to confirm that this CD was produced for the Russian market. Although this release looks fairly official, the title &quot;Cosy Prisons&quot; on the lyric page is spelt incorrectly as &quot;Cozy Prisons&quot; and the title &quot;Analogue&quot; is cut of the top of the lyric page. The catalogue number is not printed on the back of the insert booklet plus more of the artwork has been printed onto the clear plastic ring at the centre of the disc. To be confirmed if this is an official release or not.</p>
