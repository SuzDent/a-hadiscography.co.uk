The reverse offers a similar lay-out concerning background and logo, but the logo is partially covered by a 2�&quot;x3�&quot; brown and white group-shot (identical to the one used for &quot;The Blood That Moves The Body '92&quot;-releases). Track listings plus extra information is printed in white below the group-shot. In addition there are two small pictures advertising the forthcoming album &quot;Memorial Beach&quot; and video &quot;Live In South America&quot;. While &quot;Dark Is The Night&quot; (3:45) is taken from the forthcoming album, the flip is an instrumental version of &quot;Angel In The Snow&quot; (4:15) mixed by Jamey Staub and P&#0229;l Waaktaar.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td><p>Part 1 of the CD set is a fold-out digi-pak. The front cover is similar to the front of the 7&quot;, whilst the reverse differs slightly from the back cover of the 7&quot; - the a-ha-logo and small pictures of the video and album have been omitted.</td>
