                <HR>
                <P>This Japanese only mini album is available on 12&quot; vinyl EP, cassette and CD. The cover (front and reverse) is similar to the cover of the USA 12&quot; of &quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V.&quot;.
                    There were at least two pressings of the CD edition. The only difference between the sleeves seems to be a barcode printed in the top left corner of the reverse of the first pressing and the different catalogue numbers.
                </P>
                <p style="text-align:center;"><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="133" SRC="albums/45rpm2.jpg" ALT="45 R.P.M. Club CD - 1st Pressing with Obi"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/45rpm.jpg" ALT="45 R.P.M. Club CD - 2nd Pressing"></p>
                <P>The first issue comes with a red `sticker' obi strip with white a-ha-logo and text whilst the second pressing has a more regular blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; paper obi strip.

                    There are two slightly different &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; obi strips. They seem to be the same from the front, but the position of the obi-strip and catalogue number differs on the reverse.</P>
                <P>The CD has a 6 page booklet with lyrics and individual factfiles (in Japanese) plus colour pictures. The reverse of the booklet is khaki coloured with a colour group shot. The back insert has an a-ha logo with small individual pictures inside the letters. The CD is gold coloured with black titles, a red rim and Warner Brothers logo.</P>
                <P>There are also at least 2 different pressings of the EP. The covers are similar to the CD release and come with obi-strips.

                    The obi-strips differ slightly, the first (catalogue no. P-6228) is a similar colour to the bottom section of the album sleeve with text in red, black and white. The bands faces are printed within the letters of the a-ha logo. The reverse of the obi features 2 colour shots of each of the band members.

                    The second obi (catalogue no. P-6238) is light grey with red, black and white text. The a-ha logo is black and doesn't have band pictures printed within the letters. The reverse of the obi has pictures of the &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; and &quot;45 R.P.M.&quot; covers, information plus the Japanese tour dates. All text is in Japanese.
                <P>The cassette has a yellow cover with one red spine and one yellow spine. The same picture as used on the LP and CD is positioned at the top of the sleeve with a large red logo below and other black text.
