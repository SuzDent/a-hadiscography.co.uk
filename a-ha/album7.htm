The text on the obi translates as &quot;After three-year silence, the legendary Norwegian group releases new album precisely after 20 years from that time, when their Take On Me hit became leader in Billboard's Top10&quot;. The back of the insert has adverts for Texas, The Cardigans and The Future Sound Of.</p>
<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="151" SRC="albums/anal_rus.jpg" ALT="Analogue Russian? lyric page" ALIGN="RIGHT">Another, possibly Russian, edition of the album is almost identical to the regular European release, but has 3 bonus tracks which are 3 mixes of &quot;Celice&quot;: Radio Cut, Live at Frognerparken and Paul Van Dyk's Radio Edit. It doesn't come with an obi-strip and appears not to include the a-ha desktop player. There is no text to confirm that this CD was produced for the Russian market. Although this release looks fairly official, the title &quot;Cosy Prisons&quot; on the lyric page is spelt incorrectly as &quot;Cozy Prisons&quot; and the title &quot;Analogue&quot; is cut of the top of the lyric page. The catalogue number is not printed on the back of the insert booklet plus more of the artwork has been printed onto the clear plastic ring at the centre of the disc. To be confirmed if this is an official release or not.</p>

<p><B>South Africa: The South African release is similar to the European release with a few differences: On the back sleeve, the full track listing is printed in a brownish colour rather than grey.

There is a white barcode included on the back sleeve but is smaller than on the European release, the regular &quot;Polydor&quot; and &quot;Universal&quot; logos are also shown but there is an addition white &quot;RiSA&quot; logo included alongside. On the spine, the title &quot;ANALOGUE&quot; has again been printed in brown instead of the usual grey, plus the catalogue number STARCD 6975 172 has been displayed next to the title instead of being next to the &quot;Polydor/Universal&quot; logos.
