<p>The regular 7&quot; release of &quot;You Are The One&quot; features a multicolour band-shot (P&aring;l, Mags &amp; Morten) by Just Loomis with a very noticeable parrot perched on Morten's shoulder.
All writing has been printed in light blue colour, with the a-ha-logo placed in the upper mid-section and the song title plus &quot;(Remix)&quot; positioned in the lower mid-section of the sleeve. The reverse is white with a small picture of the &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;-album and all additional writing in black. Justin Strauss is responsible for the 3:48-remix of &quot;You Are The One&quot; while the flip features the LP-version of &quot;Out Of Blue Comes Green&quot; (6:25).

The 12&quot;  features a multicolour band-shot as well, but the parrot has been omitted and the band members have switched places (Mags, P&#0229;l &amp; Morten). The positioning of the logo and the title is similar to the 7&quot; edition, but the colour of the title has been changed to light green. The reverse features information on the additional Justin Strauss remixes &quot;12&quot; Remix&quot; (6:25) plus &quot;Instrumental&quot; (4:00) presented in a layout similar to the 7&quot;-release.</p>

A limited edition 12&quot; picture disc features three individual multicoloured shots (P&#0229;l, Morten &amp; Mags) from the same photo-session separated by white strips. The logo is identical, but &quot;You Are The One 12 Inch Remix&quot; has been written in white capital letters on a purple background. The reverse is light grey and offers a huge a-ha-logo with purple &quot;a's&quot; and a light blue &quot;h&quot;. The song titles and WB-logo are in purple as well, while any additional information has been printed in black letters.
<p>12&quot; promotional copies with three different remixes by Justin Strauss come without a picture sleeve. The previously unreleased &quot;Dub Version&quot; (7:18) constitute the track listing along with the 7&quot; and 12&quot; remixes from the regular release.</p>
