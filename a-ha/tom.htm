<H2>Take On Me - 1st release (19.10.84)</H2>
<P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="149" SRC="singles/tom17.jpg" ALT="Take On Me 1st release UK 7&quot;" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The first edition of &quot;Take On Me&quot; comes in a silver and white sleeve. The front features a black and white group-shot with Magne, P&#0229;l and Morten (seen from the left to the right). The a-ha logo is printed in a deep blue colour in the upper right hand corner, while &quot;take on me&quot; is written in the same colour in the lower right corner.</P>
<P>The flip which is all silver features 3 individual shots of Magne, P&#0229;l and Morten seen from the top to the bottom left side. Titles &quot;take on me&quot; and &quot;and you tell me&quot; are written in black.</P>
<P>This single was only released in Europe and flopped everywhere except from in Norway where it peaked at no. 3. The record is quite rare and features the original (3:10) and quite different version of the song produced by Tony Mansfield and remixed by John Ratcliff with a-ha. The B-side is &quot;And You Tell Me&quot; (1:48).</P>
<P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="149" SRC="singles/tom17_pr.jpg" ALT="Take On Me 1st release UK 7&quot; with promo lizard sticker" ALIGN="RIGHT">
As with most releases, there exist mispressings of the 7&quot; release, such as one which has the same &quot;Take On Me&quot; disc sticker on both sides of the disc and one which has a regular &quot;Take On Me&quot; label on the a-side and a white WEA label on the b-side which is missing the titles. Promotional copies which just include a promo &quot;Lizard Approved + tel. number&quot; sticker on the cover also exist.</P>
<P>The 12&quot;-record is identical to the 7&quot;-release except for the additional information concerning the tracks. On the front sleeve &quot;Long Version&quot; is printed in silver under the title and on the reverse, the tracks are listed as &quot;Take On Me&quot; (long version) <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="152" SRC="singles/tom1_poster.jpg" ALT="Take On Me 1st release poster" ALIGN="RIGHT">
(3:44) and &quot;Stop! And Make Your Mind Up&quot; (2:57). Neither of these 
two tracks can be found anywhere else, a fact which explains the high collector value. While the former track was produced by Tony Mansfield and remixed by John Ratcliff, the latter was produced by a-ha with John Ratcliff. Even though the song was accompanied by a unique video (not the cartoon) a picture disc was never released.</P>
<P>An even rarer promotional edition of the 12&quot; comes with a fold out poster (24&quot;x24&quot;) featuring a shot of the band (P&aring;l, Morten and Mags) where Morten has his arms around the other two. The a-ha logo is printed in white in the top right hand corner.</P>  
<H3>Variations</H3>
<P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="149" SRC="singles/tom1_sppr.jpg" ALT="Take On Me 1st release Spanish 7&quot; promo" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Spain:</B> The promo 7&quot; comes in the same sleeve as the regular release, but has &quot;Disco Promocional Prohibida Su Venta&quot; printed on the label.
<br/>It seems that the Spanish 12&quot; release fails to include the &quot;Demo Version&quot; of &quot;And You Tell Me&quot, even though this track is listed on the record sleeve! - Information to be confirmed.</P>
<B>New Zealand:</B> The 7&quot; of the first release of Take On Me was also available in New Zealand. It doesn't have a pictures sleeve, but comes in a blue and white wea sleeve. The promo edition has a promo sticker on the label with the text &quot;Demonstration record. Not available for sale... &quot;.</P>

<H2>Take On Me - second release (05.04.85)</H2>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td>
The second edition of &quot;Take On Me&quot; features a black and white group-shot (Magne, P&#0229;l and Morten) by Just Loomis. The a-ha-logo plus the song-title are both written in white and are placed in the upper left and upper right corners respectively.</td> 
<td><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/tom27.jpg" ALT="Take On Me 2nd release UK 7&quot;"></td>
</TABLE>
<P>The reverse contains another black and white group-shot with a woman thrown in for good measure (Morten, mysterious woman, Magne and P&#0229;l). The background is white and all information is printed in black.</P>
<P>This version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; (3:46) produced by Alan Tarney was the one that eventually caught on. </P>
<P>A real collector's item is the 7&quot; one-sided acetate test pressing which features only the album version of &quot;Take On Me&quot;. It comes in a plain sleeve and the vinyl features a silver label without any titles. Again, there exists promotional copies of the 7&quot; which feature the &quot;Lizard&quot; promo sticker on the cover.</P>
<P>The picture sleeve of the 12&quot; edition is identical to the 7&quot; release except for the additional information on the other tracks on the front and reverse. It is worth noticing that there are slight variations in the shades of dark colour of both the 7&quot; and 12&quot; ranging from the spined pitch black Spanish 12&quot; sleeve to the dark navy blue of the thinner UK and Australian editions. The 12&quot; release features an extended version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; (4:41) that was also produced by Alan Tarney. In addition the tracks present on the 7&quot; are included.</P>
<P>Although the second edition of &quot;Take On Me&quot; is in increasing demand, it is both easier to get hold of and a lot cheaper than the first release.</P>
<H3>Variations</H3>
<P><B>Argentina:</B> Promo 7&quot; without picture sleeve which has Take On Me by a-ha on one side and a track by Prince on the other. No further details.</P>
<P><B>Australia:</B>  The 7&quot; and 12&quot;-releases are identical to the U.S. releases (see below).</P>
<P><B>Brazil:</B> There is a promo 12&quot; which comes in a yellow WEA sleeve. It features the extended version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; (side 2, track 2). The disc label claims that &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; is the second track on side 2, but this is incorrect.</P>
<CENTER><P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="138" SRC="singles/tombrpro1.jpg" ALT="Brazilian promo"> &nbsp; <IMG WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="138" SRC="singles/tombrpro2.jpg" ALT="Brazilian promo - label"></P></CENTER>
<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="153" SRC="singles/tombrpr.jpg" ALT="Take On Me Brazilian promo (features other artists)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<br/>There is also a Brazilian 12&quot; promo which features the track &quot;Take On Me&quot; by a-ha (track 2 on side 2), plus 3 other tracks by various artists. It comes in a dark red sleeve with the WEA logo in large white letters at the top and track listing in white at the bottom.</P>
<P><B>Canada:</B> The Canadian 7&quot; comes in a white paper WEA company sleeve.</P>
<P><B>Equador:</B> The 7&quot; doesn't come with a picture sleeve.</P>

<tr><td WIDTH="250"><B>Japan:</B> The 7&quot; has a picture insert similar to the USA sleeve (see below), but with red and black Japanese writing across the top of the front and whiter in colour. The reverse has the lyrics for &quot;Take On Me&quot;, a different a-ha picture and additional Japanese text in black.</td>

</TABLE></P>
<P>There are two different WEA 12&quot; promo  releases. One features the album version of &quot;Take On Me&quot;, the other features the extended version. Both vinyls include other artists besides a-ha.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD WIDTH="250"><B>Mexico:</B> The 7&quot; comes in a white and grey wea sleeve. The titles are written in Spanish as &quot;Tomane&quot; and &quot;El amor es razon&quot;. 
<br/>There is also a rare Mexican 12&quot; which comes in a unique sleeve. The front of the sleeve is white with a thick black border around the edge. A band shot (Morten, Mags, P&aring;l) with a red a-ha logo and white &quot;hunting high and low&quot; text at the bottom has been rotated and printed at an angle so that the top left corner is disappearing off the side of the sleeve.
A thick black 'shadow' has been placed along the bottom and right hand sides of the picture. In the top right hand corner &quot;Tomame&quot; has been printed in red with &quot;Take On Me&quot; in blue underneath and &quot;remix&quot; in red underneath that.

The reverse of the sleeve features the same picture (but full length) which has been printed on the left hand side, but not rotated. The right hand side of the sleeve is black with track details in red and white font. In addition, the &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; album sleeve has been printed at the bottom of the picture. On the disc label, the track has been labeled as &quot;Take On Me / Tomame&quot;</P>
<P><B>Peru:</B> The Peru 7&quot; comes in a white paper sleeve with the text &quot;EL VIRREY&quot; INDUSTRIAS MUSICALES S.A. and an address printed in blue along the bottom. The disc label is light brown with the tracks written as &quot;Tomame&quot; and &quot;El Amor Es La Razon&quot; with the English titles in smaller letters underneath.</P>

<P>The promo copy comes in paper sleeve and has the same catalogue number. The label is paler in colour and has the WEA logo and &quot;Disco De Promocion Prohibida Su Venta&quot; printed at the top.</P>
<P><B>Philippines:</B> The 7&quot; comes in a white company sleeve. The label is beige with black text. There are two slightly different versions, one has a darker label than the other.</p>
<P><CENTER><IMG WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/tom_phil7.jpg" ALT="Take On Me Philippines 7&quot;"></CENTER></P>
<P>There is a unique 12&quot; promo which comes in a picture sleeve. The cover is black and red in colour with a unique band shot in the centre (Morten, P&aring;l, Mags). The picture has been placed over the top of a mauve irregular shape which resembles a piece of torn paper. A red a-ha logo is placed in the top right hand corner with the title in white in the bottom left. The reverse of the sleeve is grey and light blue, again with a torn paper affect where the two colours meet. A large 'etched' a-ha logo (similar to that used on the front of the U.S. 12&quot; promo) is positioned at the top of the sleeve. In the bottom section is additional text plus a small black and white picture of the band (Morten, P&aring;, Mags).</P>

<P>This Philippines promo 12&quot; can also be found in a &quot;12&quot; Disco Single&quot; sleeve which has a picture of a 12&quot; vinyl on a white background with &quot;12&quot; Disco Single&quot; printed in blue, white and yellow at the top. The record label can be seen through the cut out in the centre.</P>

<P><B>Portugal:</B> The 7&quot; has the same sleeve as USA release (see below), the only difference in the back of the sleeve is the track listing as it has b-side &quot;And You Tell Me&quot; (printed as &quot;Andy You Tell Me&quot;) instead of &quot;Love Is Reason&quot;. 
<IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="145" SRC="singles/tomsa7.jpg" ALT="Take On Me South African 7&quot;" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<H2>Take On Me - third release (16.09.85)</H2>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<tr><td WIDTH="250">The third release of &quot;Take On Me&quot; in Europe featured the same tracks as the second edition. However, the picture sleeve had undergone some serious changes and now showed a multicolour group-shot (Morten, P&#0229;l and Magne) by Robert Erdmann. A red logo is placed on a grey background in the upper left corner, while &quot;Take On Me&quot; is written in small letters to the upper right.

<B>Brazil:</B> The Brazilian 12&quot; promo sampler &quot;Best of the Past - Vol. III&quot; was released in 1993. It features the Alan Tarney version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; plus tracks by other artists. The 12&quot; comes in a colour picture sleeve with a drawing of the band (P&aring;l, Morten, Mags) by a Brazilian artist.
<br/>The title &quot;Best of the Past&quot; is printed inside a large dark star in the bottom left hand corner. A picture of the band Chicago is in the bottom right hand corner of the sleeve. The reverse features adverts for the other two Volumes which also feature a-ha songs (Crying in the Rain and ?) plus drawings of the band and other artists.</P>
