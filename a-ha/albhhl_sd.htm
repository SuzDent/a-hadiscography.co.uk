<p>The albums are available in jewel cases and also in special digi-paks (from Rhino Records and for purchase in Norway).</p>
<p>The front cover of the UK remastered edition of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; comes in a jewel case with a flip tray; it is similar to the front of the original 1985 release but with a lighter grey a-ha logo. Unlike the original releases, which come with a folded insert, these deluxe releases contain instead a 10-page, double sided, booklet with some history of the band, photos and lyrics for the original album. There is a red rectangular sticker with black and white printed text located on the front of the CD case, which reads: &quot;REMASTERED & EXPANDED with rare & unreleased gems including original 7" version of &quot;TAKE ON ME&quot; and demo of b-side &quot;DRIFTWOOD&quot;. The back cover is similar to the reverse of the inside insert, which was included with the original release, but with the track listing in place of the information about compact discs. The barcode number &quot;0 8122 79795 3 9&quot; located at the top right hand corner and Catalogue number 8122797953 on the spine is different. The production and copyright text displayed along the bottom of the back sleeve has also been changed to read; &quot;This Reissue ℗ & © 2010 Rhino Entertainment Company, a Warner Music Group Company. All Rights Reserved. Manufactured & Marketed by Rhino Entertainment Company, 3400 W. Olive Ave., Burbank, CA 91505-4614. Unauthorized copying, hiring, lending, public performance, and broadcasting of this recording prohibited. Printed in E.U. LC02982 www.rhino.com&quot;. The &quot;WB RECORDS&quot; and &quot;RHINO&quot; logos are additionally included in the bottom right hand corner. The discs are white with printed 'pencil horizontal and vertical lines plus the a-ha logo in grey with the title and disc 1 / 2 in red letters. Disc One has a red ring round the centre of the disc, while Disc Two has a grey ring. When looking through the clear plastic tray, you can see a cartoon drawing of the band (Paul, Morten and Magne) displayed on the inside of the back sleeve.</p>

<p>The European digipak edition is similar to the UK jewel case edition with the same 10-page booklet and white coloured discs, but on the outside front cover, the a-ha logo is printed in dark grey on grey, rather than white on grey which appears on the booklet. The same red rectangular sticker with black and white text, which appears on the UK jewel case edition, is included at the bottom of the front cover. The track "The Sun Always Shines On T.V. (Extended Mix)" is the rare version by Alan Tarney, which was previously unreleased onto CD, not the mix by Steve Thompson. On the back sleeve, the same layout including full track listing, black and white photos of the three band members and production and copyright text is shown, but the digipak comes with a larger barcode displaying a different number &quot;0 81227 97999 7&quot; in the top right hand corner. The Catalogue number 8122797999 shown on the spine is again different compared to the one included on the original release and the remastered UK jewel case edition. The two-fold digipak opens out to reveal the two discs which sit in transparent trays through which &quot;Take On Me&quot; style black and white drawings can be seen through. The reverse of the pocket, which houses the booklet, has a 'negative' style black and white shot of the band in front of a mirror. The regular black and white version of this shot is printed and included on the inside back cover of the digipak.</p>

The full track listing to each album is included in black text and overdubbed on top of the back sleeve artworks, in order to make two separate columns for each disc.
