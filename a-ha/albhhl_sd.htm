<HR>
<p>The remastered 2-disc Deluxe Editions of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; and &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; were released in the UK on 5 July, in Japan on 31 July and in Germany on 6 August. They were also released in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and USA.</p>
<p>Disc one of both Deluxe Editions feature the remastered album plus bonus mixes. Disc two of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; features demos, early versions and unreleased tracks, some of which are previously unreleased. Disc two of &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; features demo versions and live tracks, some of which are previously unreleased. There are some additional tracks available only for download for both albums.</p>
<p>The albums are available in jewel cases and also in special digi-paks (from Rhino Records and for purchase in Norway).</p>
<p>The jewel case editions have a flip tray. Unlike the original releases which come with a folded insert, these deluxe releases come with a 10 page, double sided, booklet with history of the band, photos and lyrics for the original album.</p>

<p>The front cover of &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; is similar to the front of the original release but with darker print. The back cover is similar to the reverse of the insert which comes with the original release but with the track listing in place of the information about compact discs. The discs are white with printed 'pencil horizontal and vertical lines plus the a-ha logo in grey plus the title and disc 1 / 2 in red letters. Disc one has a red ring round the centre of the disc while disc two has a grey ring. Through the tray you can see a cartoon drawing of the band (Paul, Morten, Magne). There is a red sticker with white and black text on the front of the case which reads: &quot;REMASTERED &amp; EXPANDED with rare &amp; unreleased gems including original 7&quot; version of &quot;TAKE ON ME&quot; and demo of b-side &quot;DRIFTWOOD&quot;.</p>

<p>The digipak edition is similar to the jewel case edition with the same booklet and discs, but on the outside cover, the a-ha logo is printed in dark gray on gray, and on the booklet, the logo is white on gray.
&quot;The Sun Always Shines On T.V. (Extended Mix)&quot; is the rare version by Alan Tarney, previously unreleased on CD, not the mix by Steve Thompson.
The two-fold digipak opens out to reveal the two discs which sit in transparent trays through which &quot;Take On Me&quot; style black and white drawings can be seen through. The reverse of the pocket which houses the booklet has a 'negative' style black and white shot of the band in front of a mirror. The regular black and white version of this shot is printed on the inside back of the digipak.</p>
