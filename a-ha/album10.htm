<HR>
<p>A special limited edition 30th Anniversary book edition of the album &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; was released on 18 September.
The cover of the hardback book features the same artwork as the original release of the album, with the full tracklisting of all 4 discs on the back. A red rectangular sticker on the front of the cellophane states in white font:
&quot;a-ha hunting high and low 30th Anniversary - Limited Edition 4CD/DVD DELUXE BOX SET loaded With Rare And Unreleased Demos, Mixes and Music Videos!&quot; with the catalogue number in smaller font below.
Inside the front and back covers of the book are song notes from the band's time at Rendezvous Studios, written on the studio's headed paper and other notes on R G Jones Studios and Trident Recording Studios headed paper. 
The 31 page double sided booklet is packed with photos from the band's early career, extracts for their notebooks, some of the story of the early years and song lyrics. At the back of the book are 4 thick cardboard pages which house the four CDs and DVD and feature drawing from the &quot;Take On Me&quot; video plus track information.
