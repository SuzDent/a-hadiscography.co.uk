<p>There is also a two disc (1 CD, 1 DVD) cardboard digi-pak edition. It doesn't specify where it was distributed, but the back cover states that it was made in the EU.

It is similar to the European deluxe digi-pak but with space for only two discs, rather than three. The printing on the CD is a much paler blue than the other releases. The DVD (PAL) is the same as the German deluxe edition, but the quality of the printing is of lower quality.
