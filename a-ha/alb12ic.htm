<p>The 12&quot; EP comes with a white obi with pink and purple Japanese text. The disc labels feature coloured &quor;Reprise Records&qupt; design. Side 1 is grey with a large white Reprise Records &quot;r&quot; and black &quot;Reprise Records&quot; train and logo at the bottom. The other text is grey. Side 2 is of similar design, but the grey background is replaced by red.</p>

        also comes with a white stickered obi strip with red a-ha-logo and text whilst the reissue comes with a blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; paper obi.
    <P>Some (if not all?) of the first pressing have the title spelt incorrectly on the disc as &quot;Twelve Ihch Club&quot;.</P>

        The CD booklet has 4 grey coloured pages with lyrics, a black and white group picture plus 3 individual pictures. The back of the booklet is similar to the back of the CD, but without the track listing. The label is &quot;Reprise Records&quot;.
        The CD is gold like the 45 R.P.M, but with a red &quot;Reprise Records&quot; logo.</P>
