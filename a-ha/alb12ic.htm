        The cover of this Japanese only mini album is similar to that of &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; single (front and back). It is available on CD, 12&quot; and cassette.
    <P>Again there were two pressings of the CD issue. The first pressing has a barcode printed in the top left corner of the reverse sleeve and a different catalogue number from the 2nd pressing. The first pressing
        <IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/ticdisc.jpg" ALT="Twelve Ihch Club - 1st pressing disc" ALIGN="RIGHT">
        also comes with a white stickered obi strip with red a-ha-logo and text whilst the reissue comes with a blue and white &quot;Forever Young Series&quot; paper obi.
    <P>Some (if not all?) of the first pressing have the title spelt incorrectly on the disc as &quot;Twelve Ihch Club&quot;.</P>
    <P><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" SRC="albums/tic.jpg" ALT="Twelve Inch Club - 2nd Pressing" ALIGN="RIGHT">
        The CD booklet has 4 grey coloured pages with lyrics, a black and white group picture plus 3 individual pictures. The back of the booklet is similar to the back of the CD, but without the track listing. The label is &quot;Reprise Records&quot;.
        The CD is gold like the 45 R.P.M, but with a red &quot;Reprise Records&quot; logo.</P>

        The LP comes with  a black and white fold-out insert.
    <P>The cassette edition comes with a long wrap-around sleeve. The front (and the left spine) is silver with a small shot of the album cover at the top. Titles are printed in red and black below. The rest of the sleeve is yellow with titles in black and blue. There is a small shot of the cover artwork on the right hand spine. The cassette is white with black stickered  labels with white text.</P>
