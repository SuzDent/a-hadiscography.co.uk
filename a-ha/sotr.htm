the UK 7&quot; except that it is black and white rather than brown and white. The &quot;a-ha&quot; writing is light blue and purple and there is white and red Japanese writing on the sleeve.

<IMG WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/sotrjap7c.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads German 7&quot; with Japanese promo sticker" ALIGN="RIGHT">
for promotional purposes in Japan. These promotional copies have a white sticker on the front of the sleeve with what seems like hand written Japanese black writing.

clear flexi disc. In the centre of the disc the title and a-ha logo are printed in large capital letters. The disc comes in a paper sleeve.
<p>For the first time there is an a-ha 3&quot; CD released in Japan.
It comes in a 3&quot; by 6&quot; snap-pack, the front of which has a top half identical to the UK single and a bottom half of dark navy colour with a large light purple a-ha-logo with red and white Japanese text below. The reverse is light purple with black text including the lyrics in English and Japanese. There is also a tiny black and white picture of the &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; album.
<IMG WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="150" SRC="singles/sotrjap3.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads Japanese 3&quot; CD" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The CD is silver coloured with black titles and a-ha-logo and red WB-logo.
<p><B>Portugal:</B> The 7&quot; sleeve is basically the same as the UK sleeve. However the front is noticeably much browner with blue and purple &quot;a-ha&quot; while the back is all in black and white. The time written on the 7&quot; for &quot;Soft Rains Of April&quot; is 4:12, but it is the same version as featured on UK copies.

<p><IMG WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="148" SRC="singles/sotr_us7.jpg" ALT="Stay On These Roads U.S. 7&quot; (back sleeve)" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>USA:</B> The front of the U.S. 7&quot;-release is identical to the UK edition, while there are a few differences concerning the reverse. The tour dates for the European leg of the World Tour 1988/89 have naturally been omitted while the three photos are identical. Only &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; has been listed as a track and is printed in purple handwriting across the mid section of the reverse. A major difference is the selection of the album version of &quot;You'll End Up Crying&quot; as b-side. Another difference is that the version of &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; found on the 7&quot; is an edited version (3:50) although this fact is not mentioned on the sleeve. The promo 7&quot; has the same cover, but features an edit version of &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot; (3:50) on both sides of the record.
